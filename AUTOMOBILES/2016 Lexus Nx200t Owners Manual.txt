For your information

Main Owner’s Manual
Please note that this manual applies to all models and explains all equipment, including
options. Therefore, you may find some explanations for equipment not installed on your
vehicle. 
All specifications provided in this manual are current at the time of printing. However,
because of the Lexus policy of continual product improvement, we reserve the right to
make changes at any time without notice.
Depending on specifications, the vehicle shown in the illustrations may differ from your
vehicle in terms of color and equipment.

Noise from under vehicle after turning off the engine
Approximately five hours after the engine is turned off, you may hear sound coming from
under the vehicle for several minutes. This is the sound of a fuel evaporation leakage
check and, it does not indicate a malfunction.

Accessories, spare parts and modification of your Lexus
A wide variety of non-genuine spare parts and accessories for Lexus vehicles are cur-
rently available in the market. You should know that Toyota does not warrant these prod-
ucts and is not responsible for their performance, repair, or replacement, or for any
damage they may cause to, or adverse effect they may have on, your Lexus vehicle.
This vehicle should not be modified with non-genuine Lexus products. Modification with
non-genuine Lexus products could affect its performance, safety or durability, and may
even violate governmental regulations. In addition, damage or performance problems
resulting from the modification may not be covered under warranty.

NX200t_OM_USA_OM78081U

Installation of a mobile two-way radio system
The installation of a mobile two-way radio system in your vehicle could affect electronic
systems such as:
● Multiport fuel injection system/sequential multiport fuel injection system
● Dynamic radar cruise control system
● Cruise control system
● Anti-lock brake system
● SRS airbag system
● Seat belt pretensioner system
Be sure to check with your Lexus dealer for precautionary measures or special instruc-
tions regarding installation of a mobile two-way radio system.

Vehicle data recordings
Your Lexus is equipped with several sophisticated computers that will record certain
data, such as:

• Engine speed
• Accelerator status
• Brake status
• Vehicle speed
• Shift position

The recorded data varies according to the vehicle grade level and options with which it is
equipped. Furthermore, these computers do not record conversations, sounds or pic-
tures.
● Data usage

Lexus may use the data recorded in these computers to diagnose malfunctions, con-
duct research and development, and improve quality.
Lexus will not disclose the recorded data to a third party except:
• With the consent of the vehicle owner or with the consent of the lessee if the vehicle

is leased
• In response to an official request by the police, a court of law or a government

agency
• For use by Lexus in a lawsuit
• For research purposes where the data is not tied to a specific vehicle or vehicle

owner
● Usage of data collected through Safety Connect / Lexus Enform (U.S. mainland only)

If your Lexus has Safety Connect or Lexus Enform and if you have subscribed to those
services, please refer to the Safety Connect / Lexus Enform Telematics Subscription
Service Agreement for information on data collected and its usage.

NX200t_OM_USA_OM78081U



10

Event data recorder
This vehicle is equipped with an event data recorder (EDR). The main purpose of an EDR
is to record, in certain crash or near crash-like situations, such as an air bag deployment
or hitting a road obstacle, data that will assist in understanding how a vehicle’s systems
performed. The EDR is designed to record data related to vehicle dynamics and safety
systems for a short period of time, typically 30 seconds or less.
The EDR in this vehicle is designed to record such data as:

• How various systems in your vehicle were operating;
• Whether or not the driver and passenger safety belts were buckled/fastened;
• How far (if at all) the driver was depressing the accelerator and/or brake pedal; and,
• How fast the vehicle was traveling.

These data can help provide a better understanding of the circumstances in which
crashes and injuries occur.
NOTE: EDR data are recorded by your vehicle only if a non-trivial crash situation occurs;
no data are recorded by the EDR under normal driving conditions and no personal data
(e.g., name, gender, age, and crash location) are recorded. However, other parties, such
as law enforcement, could combine the EDR data with the type of personally identifying
data routinely acquired during a crash investigation. 
To read data recorded by an EDR, special equipment is required, and access to the vehi-
cle or the EDR is needed. In addition to the vehicle manufacturer, other parties, such as
law enforcement, that have the special equipment, can read the information if they have
access to the vehicle or the EDR.
● Disclosure of the EDR data

Lexus will not disclose the data recorded in an EDR to a third party except when:
• An agreement from the vehicle’s owner (or the lessee for a leased vehicle) is

obtained
• In response to an official request by the police, a court of law or a government

agency
• For use by Lexus in a lawsuit
However, if necessary, Lexus may:
• Use the data for research on vehicle safety performance
• Disclose the data to a third party for research purposes without disclosing informa-

tion about the specific vehicle or vehicle owner

NX200t_OM_USA_OM78081U

Scrapping of your Lexus
The SRS airbag and seat belt pretensioner devices in your Lexus contain explosive
chemicals. If the vehicle is scrapped with the airbags and seat belt pretensioners left as
they are, this may cause an accident such as fire. Be sure to have the systems of the SRS
airbag and seat belt pretensioner removed and disposed of by a qualified service shop or
by your Lexus dealer before you scrap your vehicle.

Perchlorate Material
Special handling may apply, See www.dtsc.ca.gov/hazardouswaste/perchlorate. 
Your vehicle has components that may contain perchlorate. These components may
include airbag, seat belt pretensioners, and wireless remote control batteries.

WARNING

■ General precautions while driving
Driving under the influence: Never drive your vehicle when under the influence of
alcohol or drugs that have impaired your ability to operate your vehicle. Alcohol and
certain drugs delay reaction time, impair judgment and reduce coordination, which
could lead to an accident that could result in death or serious injury.
Defensive driving: Always drive defensively. Anticipate mistakes that other drivers or
pedestrians might make and be ready to avoid accidents.
Driver distraction: Always give your full attention to driving. Anything that distracts the
driver, such as adjusting controls, talking on a cellular phone or reading can result in a
collision with resulting death or serious injury to you, your occupants or others.

■ General precaution regarding children’s safety
Never leave children unattended in the vehicle, and never allow children to have or use
the key.
Children may be able to start the vehicle or shift the vehicle into neutral. There is also a
danger that children may injure themselves by playing with the windows, the moon
roof, or other features of the vehicle. In addition, heat build-up or extremely cold tem-
peratures inside the vehicle can be fatal to children.

Before driving

Floor mat
Use only floor mats designed specifically for vehicles of the same model and
model year as your vehicle. Fix them securely in place onto the carpet.
1 Insert the retaining hooks (clips) into

the floor mat eyelets.

2 Turn the upper knob of each retain-
ing hook (clip) to secure the floor
mats in place. *

*: Always align the  marks.

The shape of the retaining hooks (clips) may differ from that shown in the illustration.

WARNING

Observe the following precautions. 
Failure to do so may cause the driver’s floor mat to slip, possibly interfering with the ped-
als while driving. An unexpectedly high speed may result or it may become difficult to
stop the vehicle. This could lead to an accident, resulting in death or serious injury.
■ When installing the driver’s floor mat 

● Do not use floor mats designed for other models or different model year vehicles, 1
even if they are Lexus Genuine floor mats.

● Only use floor mats designed for the driver’s seat.
● Always install the floor mat securely using the retaining hooks (clips) provided.
● Do not use two or more floor mats on top of each other.
● Do not place the floor mat bottom-side up or upside-down.

■ Before driving
● Check that the floor mat is securely fixed in

the correct place with all the provided retain-
ing hooks (clips). Be especially careful to per-
form this check after cleaning the floor.

● With the engine stopped and the shift lever in
P, fully depress each pedal to the floor to
make sure it does not interfere with the floor
mat.

28 1-1. For safe use

For safety drive

For safe driving, adjust the seat and mirror to an appropriate position before
driving.

Correct driving posture
1 Adjust the angle of the seatback so

that you are sitting straight up and so
that you do not have to lean forward
to steer. (P. 137)

2 Adjust the seat so that you can
depress the pedals fully and so that
your arms bend slightly at the elbow
when gripping the steering wheel.
(P. 137, 151)

3 Lock the head restraint in place with the center of the head restraint closest to
the top of your ears. (P. 149)

4 Wear the seat belt correctly. (P. 30)

Correct use of the seat belts
Make sure that all occupants are wearing their seat belts before driving the vehi-
cle. (P. 30)
Use a child restraint system appropriate for the child until the child becomes
large enough to properly wear the vehicle’s seat belt. (P. 58)

Adjusting the mirrors
Make sure that you can see the rear of the vehicle clearly, by adjusting the inside
and outside rear view mirrors properly. (P. 153, 155)

NX200t_OM_USA_OM78081U



1-1. For safe use 29

WARNING

Observe the following precautions.
Failure to do so may result in death or serious injury.
● Do not adjust the position of the driver’s seat while driving.

Doing so could cause the driver to lose control of the vehicle.
● Do not place a cushion between the driver or passenger and the seatback.

A cushion may prevent correct posture from being achieved, and reduce the effec- 1
tiveness of the seat belt and head restraint.

● Do not place anything under the front seats.
Objects placed under the front seats may become jammed in the seat tracks and stop
the seat from locking in place. This may lead to an accident and the adjustment mech-
anism may also be damaged.

● When driving over long distances, take regular breaks before you start to feel tired.
Also, if you feel tired or sleepy while driving, do not force yourself to continue driving
and take a break immediately.

comes fully over the shoulder, but
does not come into contact with the
neck or slide off the shoulder.

● Position the lap belt as low as possi-
ble over the hips.

● Adjust the position of the seatback.
Sit up straight and well back in the
seat.

● Do not twist the seat belt.

Seat belt pretensioners (front seats)
The pretensioners help the seat belts to
quickly restrain the occupants by
retracting the seat belts when the vehi-
cle is subjected to certain types of
severe frontal or side collision or a vehi-
cle rollover.

The pretensioners do not activate in the
event of a minor frontal impact, a minor
side impact or a rear impact.

NX200t_OM_USA_OM78081U

For safety and security



34 1-1. For safe use

■ Emergency locking retractor (ELR)
The retractor will lock the belt during a sudden stop or on impact. It may also lock if you
lean forward too quickly. A slow, easy motion will allow the belt to extend so that you can
move around fully.

■ Automatic locking retractor (ALR)
When a passenger’s shoulder belt is completely extended and then retracted even
slightly, the belt is locked in that position and cannot be extended. This feature is used to
hold the child restraint system (CRS) firmly. To free the belt again, fully retract the belt
and then pull the belt out once more.

■ Child seat belt usage
The seat belts of your vehicle were principally designed for persons of adult size. 
● Use a child restraint system appropriate for the child, until the child becomes large

enough to properly wear the vehicle’s seat belt. (P. 58)
● When the child becomes large enough to properly wear the vehicle’s seat belt, follow

the instructions regarding seat belt usage. (P. 30)
■ Replacing the belt after the pretensioner has been activated

If the vehicle is involved in multiple collisions, the pretensioner will activate for the first
collision, but will not activate for the second or subsequent collisions.

■ Seat belt extender
If your seat belts cannot be fastened securely
because they are not long enough, a personal-
ized seat belt extender is available from your
Lexus dealer free of charge.

WARNING

Observe the following precautions to reduce the risk of injury in the event of sudden
braking, sudden swerving or an accident.
Failing to do so may cause death or serious injury.
■ Wearing a seat belt

● Ensure that all passengers wear a seat belt.
● Always wear a seat belt properly. 1

● Each seat belt should be used by one person only. Do not use a seat belt for more
than one person at once, including children.

● Lexus recommends that children be seated in the rear seat and always use a seat belt
and/or an appropriate child restraint system.

● To achieve a proper seating position, do not recline the seat more than necessary. The
seat belt is most effective when the occupants are sitting up straight and well back in
the seats.

● Do not wear the shoulder belt under your arm.
● Always wear your seat belt low and snug across your hips.

■ Pregnant women
Obtain medical advice and wear the seat belt
in the proper way. (P. 30)
Women who are pregnant should position the
lap belt as low as possible over the hips in the
same manner as other occupants, extending
the shoulder belt completely over the shoulder
and avoiding belt contact with the rounding of
the abdominal area.
If the seat belt is not worn properly, not only the
pregnant woman, but also the fetus could suffer
death or serious injury as a result of sudden
braking or a collision.

WARNING

■ People suffering illness
Obtain medical advice and wear the seat belt in the proper way. (P. 30)

■ When children are in the vehicle
Do not allow children to play with the seat belt. If the seat belt becomes twisted around
a child’s neck, it may lead to choking or other serious injuries that could result in death.
If this occurs and the buckle cannot be unfastened, scissors should be used to cut the
belt.

■ Seat belt pretensioners
● Do not place anything, such as a cushion, on the front passenger’s seat. Doing so will

disperse the passenger’s weight, which prevents the sensor from detecting the pas-
senger’s weight properly. As a result, the seat belt pretensioner for the front passen-
ger’s seat may not activate in the event of a collision.

● If the pretensioner has activated, the SRS warning light will come on. In that case, the
seat belt cannot be used again and must be replaced at your Lexus dealer.

■ Adjustable shoulder anchor
Always make sure the shoulder belt is positioned across the center of your shoulder.
The belt should be kept away from your neck, but not falling off your shoulder. Failure to
do so could reduce the amount of protection in an accident and cause death or serious
injuries in the event of a sudden stop, sudden swerve or accident. (P. 33)

■ Seat belt damage and wear
● Do not damage the seat belts by allowing the belt, plate, or buckle to be jammed in

the door.
● Inspect the seat belt system periodically. Check for cuts, fraying, and loose parts. Do

not use a damaged seat belt until it is replaced. Damaged seat belts cannot protect an
occupant from death or serious injury.

● Ensure that the belt and plate are locked and the belt is not twisted.
If the seat belt does not function correctly, immediately contact your Lexus dealer.

● Replace the seat assembly, including the belts, if your vehicle has been involved in a
serious accident, even if there’s no obvious damage.

● Do not attempt to install, remove, modify, disassemble or dispose of the seat belts.
Have any necessary repairs carried out by your Lexus dealer. Inappropriate handling
may lead to incorrect operation.

■ When using the rear center seat belt
Do not use the rear center seat belt with either
buckle released. Fastening only one of the
buckles may result in death or serious injury in
case of sudden braking or a collision.

WARNING

■ Using a seat belt extender
● Do not wear the seat belt extender if you can fasten the seat belt without the extender.
● Do not use the seat belt extender when installing a child restraint system because the

belt will not securely hold the child restraint system, increasing the risk of death or
serious injury in the event of an accident.

● The personalized extender may not be safe on another vehicle, when used by another 1
person, or at a different seating position other than the one originally intended.

NOTICE

■ When releasing a seat belt extender
Press on the buckle release button on the extender, not on the seat belt, then, release
the extender from the seat belt buckle. (P. 42)
This helps prevent damage to the vehicle interior and the extender itself.

SRS airbags

The SRS airbags inflate when the vehicle is subjected to certain types of
severe impacts that may cause significant injury to the occupants. They work
together with the seat belts to help reduce the risk of death or serious injury.

◆ SRS front airbags

1 SRS driver airbag/front passenger airbag
Can help protect the head and chest of the driver and front passenger from
impact with interior components

2 SRS knee airbag
Can help provide driver protection

3 SRS seat cushion airbag
Can help restrain the front passenger.

◆ SRS side and curtain shield airbags

4 SRS side airbags
Can help protect the torso of the front seat occupants

5 SRS curtain shield airbags
● Can help protect primarily the head of occupants in the outer seats
● Can prevent the occupants from being thrown from the vehicle in the event 1

of vehicle rollover

Your vehicle is equipped with ADVANCED AIRBAGS designed based on the
US motor vehicle safety standards (FMVSS208). The airbag sensor assembly
(ECU) controls airbag deployment based on information obtained from the sen-
sors etc. shown in the system components diagram above. This information
includes crash severity and occupant information. As the airbags deploy, a
chemical reaction in the inflators quickly fills the airbags with non-toxic gas to
help restrain the motion of the occupants.

WARNING

■ SRS airbag precautions
Observe the following precautions regarding the SRS airbags. 
Failure to do so may cause death or serious injury.
● The driver and all passengers in the vehicle must wear their seat belts properly.

The SRS airbags are supplemental devices to be used with the seat belts.
● The SRS driver airbag deploys with considerable force, and can cause death or seri- 1

ous injury especially if the driver is very close to the airbag. The National Highway
Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) advises:
Since the risk zone for the driver’s airbag is the first 2 - 3 in. (50 - 75 mm) of inflation,
placing yourself 10 in. (250 mm) from your driver airbag provides you with a clear
margin of safety. This distance is measured from the center of the steering wheel to
your breastbone. If you sit less than 10 in. (250 mm) away now, you can change your
driving position in several ways:
• Move your seat to the rear as far as you can while still reaching the pedals com-

fortably.
• Slightly recline the back of the seat. Although vehicle designs vary, many drivers

can achieve the 10 in. (250 mm) distance, even with the driver seat all the way for-
ward, simply by reclining the back of the seat somewhat. If reclining the back of
your seat makes it hard to see the road, raise yourself by using a firm, non-slippery
cushion, or raise the seat if your vehicle has that feature.

• If your steering wheel is adjustable, tilt it downward. This points the airbag toward
your chest instead of your head and neck.

The seat should be adjusted as recommended by NHTSA above, while still maintain-
ing control of the foot pedals, steering wheel, and your view of the instrument panel
controls.

42 1-1. For safe use

WARNING

■ SRS airbag precautions
● If the seat belt extender has been connected

to the front seat belt buckles but the seat belt
extender has not also been fastened to the
latch plate of the seat belt, the SRS front air-
bags will judge that the driver and front pas-
senger are wearing the seat belt even though
the seat belt has not been connected. In this
case, the SRS front airbags may not activate
correctly in a collision, resulting in death or
serious injury in the event of a collision. Be
sure to wear the seat belt with the seat belt
extender.

● The SRS front passenger airbag also deploys with considerable force, and can cause
death or serious injury especially if the front passenger is very close to the airbag. The
front passenger seat should be as far from the airbag as possible with the seatback
adjusted, so the front passenger sits upright.

● Improperly seated and/or restrained infants and children can be killed or seriously
injured by a deploying airbag. An infant or child who is too small to use a seat belt
should be properly secured using a child restraint system. Lexus strongly recom-
mends that all infants and children be placed in the rear seats of the vehicle and prop-
erly restrained. The rear seats are safer for infants and children than the front
passenger seat. (P. 58)

WARNING

■ SRS airbag precautions
● Do not sit on the edge of the seat or lean

against the dashboard.

1

● Do not allow a child to stand in front of the
SRS front passenger airbag unit or sit on the
knees of a front passenger.

● Do not allow the front seat occupants to hold
items on their knees.

● Do not lean against the door, the roof side rail
or the front, side and rear pillars.

● Do not allow anyone to kneel on the passen-
ger seat toward the door or put their head or
hands outside the vehicle.

44 1-1. For safe use

WARNING

■ SRS airbag precautions
● Do not attach anything to or lean anything

against areas such as the dashboard, steering
wheel pad and lower portion of the instru-
ment panel. 
These items can become projectiles when the
SRS driver, front passenger and knee airbags
deploy.

● Do not attach anything to areas such as a
door, windshield glass, side door glass, front
or rear pillar, roof side rail and assist grip.

● Do not hang coat hangers or other hard objects on the coat hooks. All of these items
could become projectiles and may cause death or serious injury, should the SRS cur-
tain shield airbags deploy.

● If a vinyl cover is put on the area where the SRS knee airbag will deploy, be sure to
remove it.

● Do not use seat accessories which cover the parts where the SRS side airbags and
SRS seat cushion airbag inflate as they may interfere with inflation of the SRS airbags.
Such accessories may prevent the side airbags and SRS seat cushion airbag from
activating correctly, disable the system or cause the side airbags and SRS seat cush-
ion airbag to inflate accidentally, resulting in death or serious injury.

● Do not strike or apply significant levels of force to the area of the SRS airbag compo-
nents. 
Doing so can cause the SRS airbags to malfunction.

● Do not touch any of the component parts immediately after the SRS airbags have
deployed (inflated) as they may be hot.

NX200t_OM_USA_OM78081U



1-1. For safe use 45

WARNING

■ SRS airbag precautions
● If breathing becomes difficult after the SRS airbags have deployed, open a door or

window to allow fresh air in, or leave the vehicle if it is safe to do so. Wash off any resi-
due as soon as possible to prevent skin irritation. 

● If the areas where the SRS airbags are stored, such as the steering wheel pad and
front and rear pillar garnishes, are damaged or cracked, have them replaced by your 1
Lexus dealer.

● Do not place anything, such as a cushion, on the front passenger’s seat. Doing so will
disperse the passenger’s weight, which prevents the sensor from detecting the pas-
senger’s weight properly. As a result, the SRS front airbags for the front passenger
may not deploy in the event of a collision.

■ Modification and disposal of SRS airbag system components
Do not dispose of your vehicle or perform any of the following modifications without
consulting your Lexus dealer. The SRS airbags may malfunction or deploy (inflate)
accidentally, causing death or serious injury.
● Installation, removal, disassembly and repair of the SRS airbags
● Repairs, modifications, removal or replacement of the steering wheel, instrument

panel, dashboard, seats or seat upholstery, front, side and rear pillars or roof side rails
● Repairs or modifications of the front fender, front bumper, or side of the occupant

compartment
● Installation of a grille guard (bull bars, kangaroo bar, etc.), snow plows, winches or

roof luggage carrier 
● Modifications to the vehicle’s suspension system
● Installation of electronic devices such as mobile two-way radios and CD players
● Modifications to your vehicle for a person with a physical disability

NX200t_OM_USA_OM78081U

For safety and security



46 1-1. For safe use

■ If the SRS airbags deploy (inflate)
● Slight abrasions, burns, bruising, etc., may be sustained from SRS airbags, due to the

extremely high speed deployment (inflation) by hot gases.
● A loud noise and white powder will be emitted.
● Parts of the airbag module (steering wheel hub, airbag cover and inflator) as well as the

front seats, parts of the front and rear pillars, and roof side rails, may be hot for several
minutes. The airbag itself may also be hot.

● The windshield may crack.
● For Safety Connect subscribers, if the SRS airbags deploy or in the event of a severe

rear-end collision, the system is designed to send an emergency call to the response
center, notifying them of the vehicle’s location (without needing to push the “SOS” but-
ton) and an agent will attempt to speak with the occupants to ascertain the level of
emergency and assistance required. If the occupants are unable to communicate, the
agent automatically treats the call as an emergency and helps to dispatch the necessary
emergency services. (P. 466)

■ SRS airbag deployment conditions (SRS front airbags)
● The SRS front airbags will deploy in the event of an impact that exceeds the set threshold

level (the level of force corresponding to an approximately 12-18 mph [20-30 km/h]
frontal collision with a fixed wall that does not move or deform).
However, this threshold velocity will be considerably higher in the following situations:
• If the vehicle strikes an object, such as a parked vehicle or sign pole, which can move

or deform on impact
• If the vehicle is involved in an underride collision, such as a collision in which the

front of the vehicle “underrides”, or goes under, the bed of a truck
● Depending on the type of collision, it is possible that only the seat belt pretensioners will

activate.
● The SRS front airbags for the front passenger will not activate if there is no passenger

sitting in the front passenger seat. However, the SRS front airbags for the front passen-
ger may deploy if luggage is put in the seat, even if the seat is unoccupied. (P. 51)

● The SRS seat cushion airbag on the front passenger seat will not operate if the occu-
pant is not wearing a seat belt.

■ SRS airbag deployment conditions (SRS side and curtain shield airbags)
● The SRS side and curtain shield airbags will deploy in the event of an impact that

exceeds the set threshold level (the level of force corresponding to the impact force
produced by an approximately 3300 lb. [1500 kg] vehicle colliding with the vehicle
cabin from a direction perpendicular to the vehicle orientation at an approximate
speed of 12 -18 mph [20 -30 km/h]).

● The SRS curtain shield airbags will deploy in the event of vehicle rollover.
● The SRS side and curtain shield airbags may also deploy in the event of a severe frontal

collision.

NX200t_OM_USA_OM78081U



1-1. For safe use 47

■ Conditions under which the SRS airbags may deploy (inflate), other than a collision
The SRS front airbags and SRS side and curtain shield airbags may also deploy if a seri-
ous impact occurs to the underside of your vehicle. Some examples are shown in the
illustration.
● Hitting a curb, edge of pavement or hard sur-

face
● Falling into or jumping over a deep hole
● Landing hard or falling 1

The SRS curtain shield airbags may also deploy under the situations shown in the illustra-
tion.
● The angle of vehicle tip-up is marginal.
● The vehicle skids and hits a curb stone.

■ Types of collisions that may not deploy the SRS airbags (SRS front airbags)
The SRS front airbags do not generally inflate if the vehicle is involved in a side or rear
collision, if it rolls over, or if it is involved in a low-speed frontal collision. But, whenever a
collision of any type causes sufficient forward deceleration of the vehicle, deployment of
the SRS front airbags may occur.
● Collision from the side
● Collision from the rear
● Vehicle rollover

NX200t_OM_USA_OM78081U

For safety and security



48 1-1. For safe use

■ Types of collisions that may not deploy the SRS airbags 
(SRS side and curtain shield airbags)
The SRS side and curtain shield airbags may not activate if the vehicle is subjected to a
collision from the side at certain angles, or a collision to the side of the vehicle body other
than the passenger compartment.
● Collision from the side to the vehicle body

other than the passenger compartment
● Collision from the side at an angle

The SRS side airbags do not generally inflate if the vehicle is involved in a rear collision, if
it rolls over, or if it is involved in a low-speed side or low-speed frontal collision.
● Collision from the rear
● Vehicle rollover

The SRS curtain shield airbags do not generally inflate if the vehicle is involved in a rear
collision, if it pitches end over end, or if it is involved in a low-speed side or lowspeed fron-
tal collision.
● Collision from the rear
● Pitching end over end

WARNING

■ Front passenger occupant classification system precautions
Observe the following precautions regarding the front passenger occupant classifica-
tion system. 
Failure to do so may cause death or serious injury.
● Wear the seat belt properly.
● Make sure the front passenger’s seat belt plate has not been left inserted into the 1

buckle before someone sits in the front passenger seat.
● Make sure the “AIR BAG OFF” indicator light is not illuminated when using the seat

belt extender for the front passenger seat. If the “AIR BAG OFF” indicator light is illu-
minated, disconnect the extender tongue from the seat belt buckle, and reconnect
the seat belt. Reconnect the seat belt extender after making sure the “AIR BAG ON”
indicator light is illuminated. If you use the seat belt extender while the “AIR BAG
OFF” indicator light is illuminated, the SRS airbags for the front passenger will not
activate, which could cause death or serious injury in the event of a collision.

● Do not apply a heavy load to the front passenger seat or equipment (e.g. seatback
pocket).

● Do not put weight on the front passenger seat by putting your hands or feet on the
front passenger seat seatback from the rear passenger seat.

● Do not let a rear passenger lift the front passenger seat with their feet or press on the
seatback with their legs.

● Do not put objects under the front passenger seat.

56 1-1. For safe use

WARNING

■ Front passenger occupant classification system precautions
● Do not recline the front passenger seatback so far that it touches a rear seat. This may

cause the “AIR BAG OFF” indicator light to be illuminated, which indicates that the
SRS airbags for the front passenger will not activate in the event of a severe accident.
If the seatback touches the rear seat, return the seatback to a position where it does
not touch the rear seat. Keep the front passenger seatback as upright as possible
when the vehicle is moving. Reclining the seatback excessively may lessen the effec-
tiveness of the seat belt system.

● If an adult sits in the front passenger seat, the “AIR BAG ON” indicator light is illumi-
nated. If the “AIR BAG OFF” indicator is illuminated, ask the passenger to sit up
straight, well back in the seat, feet on the floor, and with the seat belt worn correctly. If
the “AIR BAG OFF” indicator still remains illuminated, either ask the passenger to
move to the rear seat, or if that is not possible, move the front passenger seat fully
rearward.

● When it is unavoidable to install a forward-facing child restraint system on the front
passenger seat, install the child restraint system on the front passenger seat in the
proper order. (P. 61)

● Do not modify or remove the front seats.
● Do not kick the front passenger seat or subject it to severe impact. Otherwise, the

SRS warning light may come on to indicate a malfunction of the front passenger
occupant classification system. In this case, contact your Lexus dealer immediately.

● Child restraint systems installed on the rear seat should not contact the front seat-
backs.

● Do not use a seat accessory, such as a cushion and seat cover, that covers the seat
cushion surface.

● Do not modify or replace the upholstery of the front seat.

Safety information for children

Observe the following precautions when children are in the vehicle.
Use a child restraint system appropriate for the child, until the child becomes
large enough to properly wear the vehicle’s seat belt.

1
● It is recommended that children sit in the rear seats to avoid accidental con-

tact with the shift lever, wiper switch, etc.
● Use the rear door child-protector lock or the window lock switch to avoid

children opening the door while driving or operating the power window acci-
dentally. (P. 117, 158)

● Do not let small children operate equipment which may catch or pinch body
parts, such as the power window, hood, back door, seats etc.

WARNING

Never leave children unattended in the vehicle, and never allow children to have or use
the key.
Children may be able to start the vehicle or shift the vehicle into neutral. There is also a
danger that children may injure themselves by playing with the windows, the moon roof
(if equipped) or other features of the vehicle. In addition, heat build-up or extremely
cold temperatures inside the vehicle can be fatal to children.

WARNING

■ When a child is riding
Observe the following precautions.
Failure to do so may result in death or serious injury.
● For effective protection in automobile accidents and sudden stops, a child must be

properly restrained, using a seat belt or child restraint system depending on the age
and size of the child. 1

● Lexus strongly urges the use of a proper child restraint system that conforms to the
size of the child, installed on the rear seat. According to accident statistics, the child is
safer when properly restrained in the rear seat than in the front seat.

● Holding a child in your or someone else’s arms is not a substitute for a child restraint
system. In an accident, the child can be crushed against the windshield or between
the holder and the interior of the vehicle.

● Place one child to a child restraint system and then secure the child with the harness
of the child restraint system.

■ Handling the child restraint system
If the child restraint system is not properly fixed in place, the child or other passengers
may be seriously injured or even killed in the event of sudden braking, sudden swerv-
ing, or an accident.
● If the vehicle were to receive a strong impact from an accident, etc., it is possible that

the child restraint system has damage that is not readily visible. In such cases, do not
reuse the restraint system.

● Make sure you have complied with all installation instructions provided with the child
restraint system manufacturer and that the system is properly secured.

● Keep the child restraint system properly secured on the seat even if it is not in use. Do
not store the child restraint system unsecured in the passenger compartment.

● If it is necessary to detach the child restraint system, remove it from the vehicle or
store it securely in the luggage compartment.

WARNING

■ When installing a child restraint system
Observe the following when installing child restraint system to the front passenger seat
if it is unavoidable. The front passenger SRS air bag inflates with considerable speed
and force that if not observed may lead to death or serious injury to the child.
● Never install a rear-facing child restraint system on the front passenger seat even if

the “AIR BAG OFF” indicator light is illuminated. In the event of an accident, the force
of the rapid inflation of the front passenger airbag can cause death or serious injury to
the child if the rear-facing child restraint system is installed on the front passenger
seat.

● A forward-facing child restraint system may be installed on the front passenger seat
only when it is unavoidable. A child restraint system that requires a top tether strap
should not be used in the front passenger seat since there is no top tether strap
anchor for the front passenger seat.

● A forward-facing child restraint system may
be installed on the front passenger seat only
when it is unavoidable. When installing a for-
ward-facing child restraint system on the front
passenger seat, move the seat as far back as
possible, and raise the seat to the upper most
position, even if the “AIR BAG OFF” indicator
light is illuminated.
If the head restraint interferes with the child
restraint system installation and the head
restraint can be removed, remove the head
restraint.

● Do not allow the child to lean his/her head or any part of his/her body against the
door or the area of the seat, front pillars or roof side rails from which the SRS side air-
bags or SRS curtain shield airbags deploy even if the child is seated in the child
restraint system. It is dangerous if the SRS side and curtain shield airbags inflate, and
the impact could cause death or serious injury to the child.

● When a booster seat is installed, always ensure that the shoulder belt is positioned
across the center of the child’s shoulder. The belt should be kept away from the child’s
neck, but not so that it could fall off the child’s shoulder.

When using a child restraint system on a rear seat

WARNING

■ When installing a child restraint system
Observe the following precautions.
Failure to do so may result in death or serious injury.
● Use child restraint system suitable to the age and size of the child and install it to the 1

rear seat.
● If the driver’s seat interferes with the child

restraint system and prevents it from being
attached correctly, attach the child restraint
system to the right-hand rear seat.

● Adjust the front passenger seat so that it does
not interfere with the child restraint system.

● Do not allow the child to lean his/her head or any part of his/her body against the
door or the area of the seat, rear pillars or roof side rails from which the SRS curtain
shield airbag deploys even if the child is seated in the child restraint system. It is dan-
gerous if the SRS curtain shield airbag inflates, and the impact could cause death or
serious injury to the child.

WARNING

■ When installing a child restraint system
Observe the following precautions.
Failure to do so may result in death or serious injury.
● Do not allow children to play with the seat belt. If the seat belt becomes twisted

around a child’s neck, it may lead to choking or other serious injuries that could result
in death.
If this occurs and the buckle cannot be unfastened, scissors should be used to cut the
belt.

● Ensure that the belt and plate are securely locked and the seat belt is not twisted.
● Shake the child restraint system left and right, and forward and backward to ensure

that it has been securely installed.
● After securing a child restraint system, never adjust the seat.
● When a booster seat is installed, always ensure that the shoulder belt is positioned

across the center of the child’s shoulder. The belt should be kept away from the child’s
neck, but not so that it could fall off the child’s shoulder.

● Follow all installation instructions provided by the child restraint system manufacturer.
● When securing some types of child restraint systems in rear seats, it may not be possi-

ble to properly use the seat belts in positions next to the child restraint without inter-
fering with it or affecting seat belt effectiveness. Be sure your seat belt fits snugly
across your shoulder and low on your hips. If it does not, or if it interferes with the child
restraint, move to a different position. Failure to do so may result in death or serious
injury.

● When installing a child restraint system in the rear center seat, adjust both seatbacks
at the same angle. Otherwise, the child restraint system cannot be securely
restrained and this may cause death or serious injuries in the event of sudden braking,
sudden swerving or an accident.

■ When installing a booster seat
To prevent the belt from going into ALR lock mode, do not fully extend the shoulder
belt. ALR mode causes the belt to tighten only. This could cause injury or discomfort to
the child. (P. 34)

■ Do not use a seat belt extender
If a seat belt extender is used when installing a child restraint system, the seat belt will
not securely hold the child restraint system, which could cause death or serious injury
to the child or other passengers in the event of sudden braking, sudden swerving or an
accident.

WARNING

■ The information display at low temperatures
Allow the interior of the vehicle to warm up before using the liquid crystal information
display. At extremely low temperatures, the information display monitor may respond
slowly, and display changes may be delayed. 
For example, there is a lag between the driver's shifting and the new gear number
appearing on the display. This lag could cause the driver to downshift again, causing
rapid and excessive engine braking and possibly an accident resulting in personal
death or injury.

NOTICE

■ To prevent damage to the engine and its components
● Do not let the indicator needle of the tachometer enter the red zone, which indicates

the maximum engine speed.
● The engine may be overheating if the engine coolant temperature gauge is in the red

● Do not leave the electronic key on top of the instrument panel or near the door pockets
when exiting the vehicle. Depending on the radio wave reception conditions, it may be
detected by the antenna outside the cabin and the door will become lockable from the
outside, possibly trapping the electronic key inside the vehicle.

● As long as the electronic key is within the effective range, the doors may be locked or
unlocked by anyone.

● Even if the electronic key is not inside the vehicle, it may be possible to start the engine
if the electronic key is near the window.

● The doors may unlock if a large amount of water splashes on the door handle, such as in
the rain or in a car wash when the electronic key is within the effective range. (The door
will automatically be locked after approximately 60 seconds if the doors are not
opened and closed.)

● If the wireless remote control is used to lock the doors when the electronic key is near
the vehicle, there is a possibility that the door may not be unlocked by the entry func-
tion. (Use the wireless remote control to unlock the doors.)

● Touching the door lock sensor while wearing gloves may delay or prevent lock opera-
tion. Remove the gloves and touch the lock sensor again.

● When the lock operation is performed using the lock sensor, recognition signals will be
shown up to two consecutive times. After this, no recognition signals will be given. 

● If the door handle becomes wet while the electronic key is within the effective range,
the door may lock and unlock repeatedly. In that case, follow the following correction
procedures to wash the vehicle:
• Place the electronic key in a location 6 ft. (2 m) or more away from the vehicle. (Take

care to ensure that the key is not stolen.)
• Set the electronic key to battery-saving mode to disable the smart access system

with push-button start. (P. 133)
● If the electronic key is inside the vehicle and a door handle becomes wet during a car

wash, a message may be shown on the multi-information display and a buzzer will
sound outside the vehicle. To turn off the alarm, lock all the doors.

● The lock sensor may not work properly if it comes into contact with ice, snow, mud, etc.
Clean the lock sensor and attempt to operate it again.

■ Adjusting the mirror angle when the vehicle is reversing

With the shift lever in R, adjust the mirror angle at a desired position.
The adjusted angle will be memorized and the mirror will automatically tilt to
the memorized angle whenever the shift lever is shifted to R from next time.

The memorized downward tilt position of the mirror is linked to the normal position
(angle adjusted with the shift lever in other than R). Therefore, if the normal posi-
tion is changed after adjustment, the tilt position will also change.
When the normal position is changed, readjust the angle in reversing.

become fogged-up, and the road will be slippery.
● Drive carefully when it starts to rain, because the road surface will be especially slip-

pery. 4
● Refrain from high speeds when driving on an expressway in the rain, because there may

be a layer of water between the tires and the road surface, preventing the steering and
brakes from operating properly.

■ Engine speed while driving
In the following conditions, the engine speed may become high while driving. This is due
to automatic up-shifting control or down-shifting implementation to meet driving condi-
tions. It does not indicate sudden acceleration.
● The vehicle is judged to be driving uphill or downhill
● When the accelerator pedal is released
● When the brake pedal is depressed while sport mode is selected

■ Restraining the engine output (Brake Override System)
● When the accelerator and brake pedals are depressed at the same time, the engine

output may be restrained.
● A warning message is displayed on the multi-information display while the system is

operating. If a warning message is shown on the multi-information display, read the
message and follow the instructions.

■ Restraining sudden start (Drive-Start Control)
● When the following unusual operation is performed, the engine output may be

restrained.
• When the shift lever is shifted from R to D, D to R, N to R, P to D, or P to R (D

includes M) with the accelerator pedal depressed, a warning message appears on

P. 94

NX200t_OM_USA_OM78081U



4-1. Before driving 169

WARNING

Observe the following precautions.
Failure to do so may result in death or serious injury.
■ When starting the vehicle

Always keep your foot on the brake pedal while stopped engine running. This prevents
the vehicle from creeping.

■ When driving the vehicle
● Do not drive if you are unfamiliar with the location of the brake and accelerator ped-

als to avoid depressing the wrong pedal. 
• Accidentally depressing the accelerator pedal instead of the brake pedal will

result in sudden acceleration that may lead to an accident.
• When backing up, you may twist your body around, leading to difficulty in operat-

ing the pedals. Make sure to operate the pedals properly.
• Make sure to keep a correct driving posture even when moving the vehicle only

slightly. This allows you to depress the brake and accelerator pedals properly.
• Depress the brake pedal using your right foot. Depressing the brake pedal using

your left foot may delay response in an emergency, resulting in an accident.
● Do not drive the vehicle over or stop the vehicle near flammable materials. 4

The exhaust system and exhaust gases can be extremely hot. These hot parts may
cause a fire if there is any flammable material nearby.

● During normal driving, do not turn off the engine. Turning the engine off while driving
will not cause loss of steering or braking control, but the power assist to these systems
will be lost. This will make it more difficult to steer and brake, so you should pull over
and stop the vehicle as soon as it is safe to do so.
However, in the event of an emergency, such as if it becomes impossible to stop the
vehicle in the normal way: P. 541

● Use engine braking (downshift) to maintain a safe speed when driving down a steep
hill.
Using the brakes continuously may cause the brakes to overheat and lose effective-
ness. (P. 198)

● Do not adjust the positions of the steering wheel, the seat, or the inside or outside rear
view mirrors while driving. 
Doing so may result in a loss of vehicle control.

● Always check that all passengers’ arms, heads or other parts of their body are not
outside the vehicle.

● AWD models: Do not drive the vehicle off-road.
This is not an AWD vehicle designed for off-road driving. Proceed with all due cau-
tion if it becomes unavoidable to drive off-road.

● Do not drive across a river or through other bodies of water.
This may cause electric/electronic components to short circuit, damage the engine or
cause other serious damage to the vehicle.

● Do not drive in excess of the speed limit. Even if the legal speed limit permits it, do not
drive over 85 mph (140 km/h) unless your vehicle has high-speed capability tires.
Driving over 85 mph (140 km/h) may result in tire failure, loss of control and possible
injury. Be sure to consult a tire dealer to determine whether the tires on your vehicle
are high-speed capability tires or not before driving at such speeds.

NX200t_OM_USA_OM78081U

Driving



170 4-1. Before driving

WARNING

Observe the following precautions.
Failure to do so may result in death or serious injury.
■ When driving on slippery road surfaces

● Sudden braking, acceleration and steering may cause tire slippage and reduce your
ability to control the vehicle.

● Sudden acceleration, engine braking due to shifting, or changes in engine speed
could cause the vehicle to skid.

● After driving through a puddle, lightly depress the brake pedal to make sure that the
brakes are functioning properly. Wet brake pads may prevent the brakes from func-
tioning properly. If the brakes on only one side are wet and not functioning properly,
steering control may be affected.

■ When shifting the shift lever
● Do not let the vehicle roll backward while the shift lever is in a driving position, or roll

forward while the shift lever is in R. 
Doing so may cause the engine to stall or lead to poor brake and steering perfor-
mance, resulting in an accident or damage to the vehicle.

● Do not shift the shift lever to P while the vehicle is moving.
Doing so can damage the transmission and may result in a loss of vehicle control.

● Do not shift the shift lever to R while the vehicle is moving forward.
Doing so can damage the transmission and may result in a loss of vehicle control.

● Do not shift the shift lever to a driving position while the vehicle is moving backward.
Doing so can damage the transmission and may result in a loss of vehicle control.

● Shifting the shift lever to N while the vehicle is moving will disengage the engine.
Engine braking is not available when N is selected.

● Be careful not to shift the shift lever with the accelerator pedal depressed. 
Shifting the shift lever to any position other than P or N may lead to unexpected rapid
acceleration of the vehicle that may cause an accident and result in death or serious
injury.

■ If you hear a squealing or scraping noise (brake pad wear limit indicators)
Have the brake pads checked and replaced by your Lexus dealer as soon as possible. 
Rotor damage may result if the pads are not replaced when needed. 
It is dangerous to drive the vehicle when the wear limits of the brake pads and/or those
of the brake discs are exceeded.

NX200t_OM_USA_OM78081U



4-1. Before driving 171

WARNING

Observe the following precautions.
Failure to do so may result in death or serious injury.
■ When the vehicle is stopped

● Do not race the engine. 
If the shift lever is in any position other than P or N, the vehicle may accelerate sud-
denly and unexpectedly, causing an accident.

● In order to prevent accidents due to the vehicle rolling away, always keep depressing
the brake pedal while the engine is running, and apply the parking brake as neces-
sary.

● If the vehicle is stopped on an incline, in order to prevent accidents caused by the
vehicle rolling forward or backward, always depress the brake pedal and securely
apply the parking brake as needed.

● Avoid revving or racing the engine.
Running the engine at high speed while the vehicle is stopped may cause the exhaust
system to overheat, which could result in a fire if combustible material is nearby.

■ When the vehicle is parked 4
● Do not leave glasses, cigarette lighters, spray cans, or soft drink cans in the vehicle

when it is in the sun. 
Doing so may result in the following:
• Gas may leak from a cigarette lighter or spray can, and may lead to a fire.
• The temperature inside the vehicle may cause the plastic lenses and plastic mate-

rial of glasses to deform or crack.
• Soft drink cans may fracture, causing the contents to spray over the interior of the

vehicle, and may also cause a short circuit in the vehicle’s electrical components.
● Do not leave cigarette lighters in the vehicle. If a cigarette lighter is in a place such as

the glove box or on the floor, it may be lit accidentally when luggage is loaded or the
seat is adjusted, causing a fire.

● Do not attach adhesive discs to the windshield or windows. Do not place containers
such as air fresheners on the instrument panel or dashboard. Adhesive discs or con-
tainers may act as lenses, causing a fire in the vehicle.

● Do not leave a door or window open if the curved glass is coated with a metallized
film such as a silver-colored one. Reflected sunlight may cause the glass to act as a
lens, causing a fire.

● Always shift the shift lever to P, apply the parking brake, stop the engine and lock the
vehicle.
Do not leave the vehicle unattended while the engine is running.

● Do not touch the exhaust pipes while the engine is running or immediately after turn-
ing the engine off. 
Doing so may cause burns.

172 4-1. Before driving

WARNING

Observe the following precautions.
Failure to do so may result in death or serious injury.
■ When taking a nap in the vehicle

Always turn the engine off. Otherwise, if you accidentally move the shift lever or
depress the accelerator pedal, this could cause an accident or fire due to engine over-
heating. Additionally, if the vehicle is parked in a poorly ventilated area, exhaust gases
may collect and enter the vehicle, leading to death or a serious health hazard.

■ When braking 
● When the brakes are wet, drive more cautiously. 

Braking distance increases when the brakes are wet, and this may cause one side of
the vehicle to brake differently than the other side. Also, the parking brake may not
securely hold the vehicle.

● If the power brake assist system does not operate, do not follow other vehicles closely
and avoid hills or sharp turns that require braking. 
In this case, braking is still possible, but the brake pedal should be depressed more
firmly than usual. Also, the braking distance will increase. Have your brakes fixed
immediately.

● Do not pump the brake pedal if the engine stalls. 
Each push on the brake pedal uses up the reserve for the power-assisted brakes.

● The brake system consists of 2 individual hydraulic systems; if one of the systems fails,
the other will still operate. In this case, the brake pedal should be depressed more
firmly than usual and the braking distance will increase. Have your brakes fixed imme-
diately.

■ If the vehicle becomes stuck (AWD models)
Do not spin the wheels excessively when any of the tires is up in the air, or the vehicle is
stuck in sand, mud, etc. This may damage the driveline components or propel the vehi-
cle forward or backward, causing an accident.

NX200t_OM_USA_OM78081U



4-1. Before driving 173

NOTICE

■ When driving the vehicle
● Do not depress the accelerator and brake pedals at the same time during driving, the

engine output may be restrained.
● Do not use the accelerator pedal or depress the accelerator and brake pedals at the

same time to hold the vehicle on a hill.
■ When parking the vehicle

Always shift the shift lever to P, set the parking brake. Failure to do so may cause the
vehicle to move or the vehicle may accelerate suddenly if the accelerator pedal is acci-
dentally depressed.

■ Avoiding damage to vehicle parts
● Do not turn the steering wheel fully in either direction and hold it there for an

extended period of time. 
Doing so may damage the power steering motor.

● When driving over bumps in the road, drive as slowly as possible to avoid damaging
the wheels, underside of the vehicle, etc.

● Make sure to idle the engine immediately after high speed driving or hill climbing, if 4
the engine is to be stopped. Stop the engine only after the turbocharger has cooled
down. (P. 168)
Failure to do so may cause damage to the turbocharger.

■ If you get a flat tire while driving 
A flat or damaged tire may cause the following situations. Hold the steering wheel
firmly and gradually depress the brake pedal to slow down the vehicle.
● It may be difficult to control your vehicle.
● The vehicle will make abnormal sounds or vibrations.
● The vehicle will lean abnormally.
Information on what to do in case of a flat tire (P. 560)

■ When encountering flooded roads
Do not drive on a road that has flooded after heavy rain, etc. Doing so may cause the
following serious damage to the vehicle:
● Engine stalling
● Short in electrical components
● Engine damage caused by water immersion
In the event that you drive on a flooded road and the vehicle is flooded, be sure to have
your Lexus dealer check the following:
● Brake function
● Changes in quantity and quality of oil and fluid used for the engine, transmission, tran-

saxle, transfer (AWD models), differential, etc.
● Lubricant condition for the propeller shaft (AWD models), bearings and suspension

joints (where possible), and the function of all joints, bearings, etc.

Cargo and luggage

Take notice of the following information about storage precautions, cargo
capacity and load.

Capacity and distribution
Cargo capacity depends on the total weight of the occupants. 
(Cargo capacity) = (Total load capacity) — (Total weight of occupants)
Steps for Determining Correct Load Limit 

(1) Locate the statement “The combined weight of occupants and cargo should
never exceed XXX kg or XXX lbs.” on your vehicle’s placard. 

(2) Determine the combined weight of the driver and passengers that will be
riding in your vehicle. 

(3) Subtract the combined weight of the driver and passengers from XXX kg or
XXX lbs.

(4) The resulting figure equals the available amount of cargo and luggage load
capacity. 
For example, if the “XXX” amount equals 1400 lbs. and there will be five
150 lb passengers in your vehicle, the amount of available cargo and luggage
load capacity is 650 lbs. (1400  750 (5150) = 650 lbs.) 

(5) Determine the combined weight of luggage and cargo being loaded on the
vehicle. That weight may not safely exceed the available cargo and luggage
load capacity calculated in Step 4. 

(6) If your vehicle will be towing a trailer, load from your trailer will be transferred
to your vehicle. Consult this manual to determine how this reduces the avail-
able cargo and luggage load capacity of your vehicle. (P. 178)
Vehicles without towing package: Lexus does not recommend towing a trailer with
your vehicle. Your vehicle is not designed for trailer towing.

2 Total load capacity (vehicle capacity

weight) (P. 590)

When 2 people with the combined weight of A lb. (kg) are riding in your vehicle,
which has a total load capacity (vehicle capacity weight) of B lb. (kg), the avail-
able amount of cargo and luggage load capacity will be C lb. (kg) as follows: 
B*2 lb. (kg)  A*1 lb. (kg) = C*3 lb. (kg)
*1: A = Weight of people 4
*2: B = Total load capacity
*3: C = Available cargo and luggage load

In this condition, if 3 more passengers with the combined weight of D lb. (kg) get on,
the available cargo and luggage load will be reduced E lb. (kg) as follows:

C lb. (kg)  D*4 lb. (kg) = E*5 lb. (kg)
*4: D = Additional weight of people
*5: E = Available cargo and luggage load
As shown in the example above, if the number of occupants increases, the cargo
and luggage load will be reduced by an amount that equals the increased weight
due to the additional occupants. In other words, if an increase in the number of
occupants causes an excess of the total load capacity (combined weight of occu-
pants plus cargo and luggage load), you must reduce the cargo and luggage on
your vehicle.

WARNING

■ Things that must not be carried in the luggage compartment
The following things may cause a fire if loaded in the luggage compartment:
● Receptacles containing gasoline
● Aerosol cans

■ Storage precautions
Observe the following precautions.
Failure to do so may prevent the pedals from being depressed properly, may block the
driver’s vision, or may result in items hitting the driver or passengers, possibly causing
an accident.
● Stow cargo and luggage in the luggage compartment whenever possible.
● Do not stack cargo and luggage in the luggage compartment higher than the seat-

backs.
● When you fold down the rear seats, long items should not be placed directly behind

the front seats.
● Never allow anyone to ride in the luggage compartment. It is not designed for pas-

sengers. They should ride in their seats with their seat belts properly fastened.
● Do not place cargo or luggage in or on the following locations.

• At the feet of the driver
• On the front passenger or rear seats (when stacking items)
• On the luggage cover
• On the instrument panel
• On the dashboard

● Secure all items in the occupant compartment.
■ Capacity and distribution

● Do not exceed the maximum axle weight rating or the total vehicle weight rating. 
● Even if the total load of occupant’s weight and the cargo load is less than the total load

capacity, do not apply the load unevenly. Improper loading may cause deterioration
of steering or braking control which may cause death or serious injury.

■ When using a roof luggage carrier (vehicles with roof rails)
Observe the following precautions:
● Place the cargo so that its weight is distributed evenly between the front and rear

axles.
● If loading long or wide cargo, never exceed the vehicle overall length or width. 

(P. 590)
● Before driving, make sure the cargo is securely fastened on the roof luggage carrier.
● Loading cargo on the roof luggage carrier will make the center of gravity of the vehi-

cle higher. Avoid high speeds, sudden starts, sharp turns, sudden braking or abrupt
maneuvers, otherwise it may result in loss of control or vehicle rollover due to failure
to operate this vehicle correctly and result in death or serious injury.

● If driving for a long distance, on rough roads, or at high speeds, stop the vehicle now
and then during the trip to make sure the cargo remains in its place.

● Do not exceed 176.3 lb. (80 kg) cargo weight on the roof luggage carrier.

Trailer towing (vehicles with towing package)

Your vehicle is designed primarily as a passenger-and-load-carrying vehicle.
Towing a trailer can have an adverse impact on handling, performance, brak-
ing, durability, and fuel consumption. For your safety and the safety of others,
you must not overload your vehicle or trailer. You must also ensure that you
are using appropriate towing equipment, that the towing equipment has been
installed correctly and used properly, and that you employ the requisite driv-
ing habits.
Vehicle-trailer stability and braking performance are affected by trailer sta-
bility, brake performance and setting, trailer brakes, the hitch and hitch sys-
tems (if equipped).
To tow a trailer safely, use extreme care and drive the vehicle in accordance
with your trailer’s characteristics and operating conditions.

Trailer towing tips
Your vehicle will handle differently when towing a trailer. Help to avoid an acci-
dent, death or serious injury, keep the following in mind when towing:
● Speed limits for towing a trailer vary by state or province. Do not exceed the

posted towing speed limit.
● Lexus recommends that the vehicle-trailer speed limit is 65 mph (104 km/h)

on a flat, straight, dry road. Do not exceed this limit, the posted towing speed
limit or the speed limit for your trailer as set forth in your trailer owner’s man-
ual, whichever is lowest. Instability of the towing vehicle-trailer combination
(trailer sway) increases as speed increases. Exceeding speed limits may cause
loss of control.

● Before starting out, check the trailer lights, tires and the vehicle-trailer con-
nections. Recheck after driving a short distance.

● Practice turning, stopping and reversing with the trailer attached in an area
away from traffic until you become accustomed to the feel of the vehicle-
trailer combination.

NX200t_OM_USA_OM78081U



4-1. Before driving 185

● Reversing with a trailer attached is difficult and requires practice. Grip the
bottom of the steering wheel and move your hand to the left to move the
trailer to the left. Move your hand to the right to move the trailer to right. (This
is generally opposite to reversing without a trailer attached.) Avoid sharp or
prolonged turning. Have someone guide you when reversing to reduce the
risk of an accident.

● As stopping distance is increased when towing a trailer, vehicle-to vehicle dis-
tance should be increased. For each 10 mph (16 km/h) of speed, allow at least
one vehicle and trailer length.

● Avoid sudden braking as you may skid, resulting in the trailer jackknifing and a
loss of vehicle control. This is especially true on wet or slippery surfaces.

● Avoid jerky starts or sudden acceleration.
● Avoid jerky steering and sharp turns, and slow down before making turn.
● Note that when making a turn, the trailer wheels will be closer than the vehicle

wheels to the inside of the turn. Compensate by making a wider than normal
4

turning radius.
● Slow down before making a turn, in cross winds, on wet or slippery surfaces,

etc.
Increasing vehicle speed can destabilize the trailer.

● Take care when passing other vehicles. Passing requires considerable dis-
tance. After passing a vehicle, do not forget the length of your trailer, and be
sure you have plenty of room before changing lanes.

● To maintain engine braking efficiency and charging system performance
when using engine braking, do not put the transmission in D. If in the M mode,
the transmission shift range position must be in 4 or lower. (P. 198)

● Instability happens more frequently when descending steep or long downhill
grades. Before descending, slow down and downshift. Do not make sudden
downshifts while descending steep or long downhill grades.

● Avoid holding the brake pedal down too long or applying the brakes too fre-
quently. This could cause the brakes to overheat and result in reduced braking
efficiency.

● Due to the added load of the trailer, your vehicle’s engine may overheat on hot
days (at temperatures over 85F [30C]) when driving up a long or steep
grade. If the engine coolant temperature gauge indicates overheating, imme-
diately turn off the air conditioning (if in use), pull your vehicle off the road and
stop in a safe spot. (P. 584)

NX200t_OM_USA_OM78081U

Driving



186 4-1. Before driving

● Always place wheel blocks under both the vehicle’s and the trailer’s wheels
when parking. Put the transmission in P and apply the parking brake. Avoid
parking on a slope, but if unavoidable, do so only after performing the follow-
ing:
1 Apply the brakes and keep them applied.
2 Have someone place wheel blocks under both the vehicle’s and trailer’s

wheels.
3 When the wheel blocks are in place, release the brakes slowly until the

blocks absorb the load.
4 Shift into P and apply the parking brake.
5 Turn off the engine.

● When restarting after parking on a slope:
1 With the transmission in P, start the engine. Be sure to keep the brake pedal

depressed.
2 Shift into a forward gear. If reversing, shift into R.
3 If the parking brake is in manual mode, release the parking brake.

(P. 205)
4 Release the brake pedal, and slowly pull or back away from the wheel

blocks. Stop and apply the brakes.
5 Have someone retrieve the blocks.

■ Matching trailer ball height to trailer coupler height
No matter which class of tow hitch
applies, for a more safe trailer hookup,
the trailer ball setup must be the proper
height for the coupler on the trailer.

1 Coupler
2 Trailer ball

4

■ Before towing
Check that the following conditions are met:
● Ensure that your vehicle’s tires are properly inflated. (P. 596)
● Trailer tires are inflated according to the trailer manufacturer’s recommendation.
● All trailer lights work as required by law.
● All lights work each time you connect them.
● The trailer ball is set at the proper height for the coupler on the trailer.
● The trailer is level when it is hitched.

Do not drive if the trailer is not level, and check for improper tongue weight, overload-
ing, worn suspension, or other possible causes.

● The trailer cargo is securely loaded.
● The rear view mirrors conform to all applicable federal, state/provincial or local regula-

tions. If they do not, install rear view mirrors appropriate for towing purposes.
■ AVS (adaptive variable suspension system) (if equipped)

The suspension can be switched for improvement in driveability. (P. 298)

NX200t_OM_USA_OM78081U

Driving



188 4-1. Before driving

■ Break-in schedule
If your vehicle is new or equipped with any new power train components (such as an
engine, transmission, differential or wheel bearing), Lexus recommends that you do not
tow a trailer until the vehicle has been driven for over 500 miles (800 km).
After the vehicle has been driven for over 500 miles (800 km), you can start towing.
However, for the next 500 miles (800 km), drive the vehicle at a speed of less than
50 mph (80 km/h) when towing a trailer, and avoid full throttle acceleration.

■ Maintenance
● If you tow a trailer, your vehicle will require more frequent maintenance due to the addi-

tional load. (See “Warranty and Services Guide”, “Owner’s Manual Supplement” or
“Scheduled Maintenance”.)

● Retighten the fixing bolts of the towing ball and bracket after approximately 600 miles
(1000 km) of trailer towing.

■ If trailer sway occurs
One or more factors (crosswinds, passing vehicles, rough roads, etc.) can adversely
affect handling of your vehicle and trailer, causing instability.
● If trailer swaying occurs:

• Firmly grip the steering wheel. Steer straight ahead.
Do not try to control trailer swaying by turning the steering wheel.

• Begin releasing the accelerator pedal immediately but very gradually to reduce
speed.
Do not increase speed. Do not apply vehicle brakes.

If you make no extreme correction with the steering or brakes, your vehicle and trailer
should stabilize.
● After the trailer swaying has stopped:

• Stop in a safe place. Get all occupants out of the vehicle.
• Check the tires of the vehicle and the trailer.
• Check the load in the trailer.

Make sure the load has not shifted.
Make sure the tongue weight is appropriate, if possible.

• Check the load in the vehicle.
Make sure the vehicle is not overloaded after occupants get in.

If you cannot find any problems, the speed at which trailer swaying occurred is beyond
the limit of your particular vehicle-trailer combination. Drive at a lower speed to pre-
vent instability. Remember that swaying of the towing vehicle-trailer increases as
speed increases.

NX200t_OM_USA_OM78081U



4-1. Before driving 189

WARNING

■ Trailer towing precautions
To tow a trailer safely, use extreme care and drive the vehicle in accordance with the
trailer’s characteristics and operating conditions. Failure to do so could cause an acci-
dent resulting in death or serious injury. Vehicle stability and braking performance are
affected by trailer stability, brake setting and performance, and the hitch. Your vehicle
will handle differently when towing a trailer.

■ To avoid accident or injury
● Do not exceed the TWR, unbraked TWR, GCWR, GVWR or GAWR.
● Adjust the tongue weight within the appropriate range. Place heavier loads as close

to the trailer axle as possible.
● Do not exceed 65 mph (104 km/h), the posted towing speed limit or the speed limit

for your trailer as set forth in your trailer owner’s manual, whichever is lowest. Slow
down sufficiently before making a turn, in cross winds, on wet or slippery surface, etc.
to help avoid an accident. If you experience a vehicle-trailer instability from reducing
a certain speed, slow down and make sure you keep your vehicle speed under the
speed of which you experience the instability.

● Do not make jerky, abrupt or sharp turns. 4

● Do not apply the brakes suddenly as you may skid, resulting in jackknifing and loss of
vehicle control. This is especially true on wet or slippery surfaces.

● Do not exceed the trailer hitch assembly weight, gross vehicle weight, gross axle
weight and trailer tongue weight capacities.

● Do not use the following systems when trailer towing.
• Cruise control (if equipped)
• Dynamic radar cruise control (if equipped)
• Dynamic cruise control with full-speed range (if equipped)

● Slow down and downshift before descending steep or long downhill grades. Do not
make sudden downshifts while descending steep or long downhill grades.

● Vehicle-trailer instability is more likely on steep long downhills. Before descending
steep or long downhill grades, slow down and downshift. Do not make sudden down-
shifts when descending steep or long downhill grades. Avoid holding the brake pedal
down too long or applying the brakes too frequently. This could cause the brakes to
overheat and result in reduced braking efficiency.

● Vehicles with a compact spare tire: Do not tow a trailer when the compact spare tire
is installed on your vehicle.

■ Hitch
Trailer hitch assemblies have different weight capacities established by the hitch manu-
facturer. Even though the vehicle may be physically capable of towing a higher weight,
the operator must determine the maximum weight rating of the particular hitch assem-
bly and never exceed the maximum weight rating specified for the trailer-hitch.
Exceeding the maximum weight rating set by the trailer-hitch manufacturer can cause
an accident resulting in death or serious personal injuries.

WARNING

■ When towing a trailer
Lexus recommends trailers with brakes that conform to any applicable federal and
state/provincial regulations.
● If the gross trailer weight exceeds unbraked TWR, trailer brakes are required. Lexus

recommends trailers with brakes that conform to all applicable federal and state/pro-
vincial regulations.

● Never tap into your vehicle’s hydraulic system, as this will lower the vehicle’s braking
effectiveness.

● Never tow a trailer without using a safety chain securely attached to both the trailer
and the vehicle. If damage occurs to the coupling unit or hitch ball, there is danger of
the trailer wandering into another lane.

NOTICE

■ When installing a trailer hitch

4-4. Refueling 227

Opening the fuel tank cap

Perform the following steps to open the fuel tank cap.

Before refueling the vehicle
● Turn the engine switch off and ensure that all the doors and windows are

closed.
● Confirm the type of fuel. (P. 599)

■ Fuel types
P. 599

■ Fuel tank opening for unleaded gasoline
To help prevent incorrect fueling, your vehicle has a fuel tank opening that only accom-
modates the special nozzle on unleaded fuel pumps. 4

WARNING

■ When refueling the vehicle
Observe the following precautions while refueling the vehicle. Failure to do so may
result in death or serious injury.
● After exiting the vehicle and before opening the fuel door, touch an unpainted metal

surface to discharge any static electricity. It is important to discharge static electricity
before refueling because sparks resulting from static electricity can cause fuel vapors
to ignite while refueling.

● Always hold the grips on the fuel tank cap and turn it slowly to remove it. 
A whooshing sound may be heard when the fuel tank cap is loosened. Wait until the
sound cannot be heard before fully removing the cap. In hot weather, pressurized fuel
may spray out of the filler neck and cause injury.

● Do not allow anyone that has not discharged static electricity from their body to come
close to an open fuel tank.

● Do not inhale vaporized fuel.
Fuel contains substances that are harmful if inhaled.

● Do not smoke while refueling the vehicle.
Doing so may cause the fuel to ignite and cause a fire.

● Do not return to the vehicle or touch any person or object that is statically charged.
This may cause static electricity to build up, resulting in a possible ignition hazard.

■ When refueling
Observe the following precautions to prevent fuel overflowing from the fuel tank:
● Securely insert the fuel nozzle into the fuel filler neck.
● Stop filling the tank after the fuel nozzle automatically clicks off.
● Do not top off the fuel tank.

232 4-5. Using the driving support systems

Driving in vehicle-to-vehicle distance control mode
This mode employs a radar sensor to detect the presence of vehicles up to
approximately 400 ft. (120 m) ahead, determines the current vehicle-to-vehicle
following distance, and operates to maintain a suitable following distance from
the vehicle ahead.

Note that vehicle-to-vehicle distance will close in when traveling on long downhill
slopes.

1 Example of constant speed cruising
When there are no vehicles ahead
The vehicle travels at the speed set by the driver. The desired vehicle-to-vehicle dis-
tance can also be set by operating the vehicle-to-vehicle distance control.

2 Example of deceleration cruising
When a preceding vehicle is driving slower than the set speed appears
When a vehicle is detected running ahead of you, the system automatically deceler-
ates your vehicle. When a greater reduction in vehicle speed is necessary, the system
applies the brakes (the stop lights will come on at this time). A warning tone warns you
when the system cannot decelerate sufficiently to prevent your vehicle from closing in
on the vehicle ahead.

3 Example of follow-up cruising 
When following a preceding vehicle is driving slower than the set speed
The system continues follow-up cruising while adjusting for changes in the speed of
the vehicle ahead in order to maintain the vehicle-to-vehicle distance set by the driver.

4 Example of acceleration 
When there are no longer any preceding vehicles driving slower than the set
speed
The system accelerates until the set speed is reached. The system then returns to con-
stant speed cruising.

WARNING

■ Before using dynamic radar cruise control
Do not overly rely on vehicle-to-vehicle distance control mode.
Be aware of the set speed. If automatic deceleration/acceleration is not appropriate,
adjust the vehicle speed, as well as the distance between your vehicle and vehicles
ahead by applying the brakes, etc.

■ Cautions regarding the driving assist systems
Observe the following precautions.
Failure to do so may cause an accident resulting in death or serious injury.
● Assisting the driver to measure following distance

The dynamic radar cruise control is only intended to help the driver in determining
the following distance between the driver’s own vehicle and a designated vehicle
traveling ahead. It is not a mechanism that allows careless or inattentive driving, and it
is not a system that can assist the driver in low-visibility conditions. It is still necessary
for driver to pay close attention to the vehicle’s surroundings.

● Assisting the driver to judge proper following distance
The dynamic radar cruise control determines whether the following distance
between the driver’s own vehicle and a designated vehicle traveling ahead is appro-
priate or not. It is not capable of making any other type of judgement. Therefore, it is
absolutely necessary for the driver to remain vigilant and to determine whether or not
there is a possibility of danger in any given situation.

● Assisting the driver to operate the vehicle
The dynamic radar cruise control has no capability to prevent or avoid a collision with
a vehicle traveling ahead. Therefore, if there is ever any danger, the driver must take
immediate and direct control of the vehicle and act appropriately in order to ensure
the safety of all involved.

■ To avoid inadvertent dynamic radar cruise control activation
Switch the dynamic radar cruise control off using the “ON/OFF” button when not in
use.

Doing so may result in inappropriate speed control and could cause an accident result-
ing in death or serious injury.
● Roads where there are pedestrians, cyclers, etc.
● In heavy traffic
● On roads with sharp bends
● On winding roads
● On slippery roads, such as those covered with rain, ice or snow
● On sharp inclines or declines 

Vehicle speed may exceed the set speed when driving down a steep hill.
● Roads with continuous inclines and declines
● At entrances to freeways and highways
● When weather conditions are bad enough that they may prevent the sensors from

detecting correctly (fog, snow, sandstorm, heavy rain, etc.) 4
● When an approach warning buzzer is heard often
● When your vehicle is towing a trailer or during emergency towing

■ When the sensor may not be correctly detecting the vehicle ahead
In the case of the following and depending on the conditions, operate the brake pedal
when deceleration of the system is insufficient or operate the accelerator pedal when
acceleration is required.
As the sensor may not be able to correctly detect these types of vehicles, the approach
warning (P. 236) will not be activated, which may lead to an accident resulting in
death or serious injury.
● Vehicles that cut in suddenly
● Vehicles traveling at low speeds
● Vehicles that are not moving in the same lane
● Vehicles with small rear ends (trailers with no load on board, etc.)

WARNING

■ Before using dynamic radar cruise control with full-speed range
Do not overly rely on vehicle-to-vehicle distance control mode.
Be aware of the set speed. If automatic deceleration/acceleration is not appropriate,
adjust the vehicle speed, as well as the distance between your vehicle and vehicles
ahead by applying the brakes, etc.

■ Cautions regarding the driving assist systems
Observe the following precautions.
Failure to do so may cause an accident resulting in death or serious injury.
● Assisting the driver to measure following distance

The dynamic radar cruise control with full-speed range is only intended to help the
driver in determining the following distance between the driver’s own vehicle and a
designated vehicle traveling ahead. It is not a mechanism that allows careless or inat-
tentive driving, and it is not a system that can assist the driver in low-visibility condi-
tions. It is still necessary for driver to pay close attention to the vehicle’s surroundings.

● Assisting the driver to judge proper following distance
The dynamic radar cruise control with full-speed range determines whether the fol-
lowing distance between the driver’s own vehicle and a designated vehicle traveling
ahead is appropriate or not. It is not capable of making any other type of judgement.
Therefore, it is absolutely necessary for the driver to remain vigilant and to determine
whether or not there is a possibility of danger in any given situation.

● Assisting the driver to operate the vehicle
The dynamic radar cruise control with full-speed range has no capability to prevent or
avoid a collision with a vehicle traveling ahead. Therefore, if there is ever any danger,
the driver must take immediate and direct control of the vehicle and act appropriately
in order to ensure the safety of all involved.

■ To avoid inadvertent dynamic radar cruise control with full-speed range activation
Switch the dynamic radar cruise control with full-speed range off using the “ON/OFF”
button when not in use.

WARNING

■ Situations unsuitable for dynamic radar cruise control with full-speed range
Do not use dynamic radar cruise control with full-speed range in any of the following
situations.
Doing so may result in inappropriate speed control and could cause an accident result-
ing in death or serious injury.
● Roads where there are pedestrians, cyclers, etc.
● In heavy traffic
● On roads with sharp bends
● On winding roads
● On slippery roads, such as those covered with rain, ice or snow
● On sharp inclines or declines 

Vehicle speed may exceed the set speed when driving down a steep hill.
● Roads with continuous inclines and declines
● At entrances to freeways and highways
● When weather conditions are bad enough that they may prevent the sensors from 4

detecting correctly (fog, snow, sandstorm, heavy rain, etc.)
● When an approach warning buzzer is heard often
● When your vehicle is towing a trailer or during emergency towing

■ When the sensor may not be correctly detecting the vehicle ahead
In the case of the following and depending on the conditions, operate the brake pedal
when deceleration of the system is insufficient or operate the accelerator pedal when
acceleration is required.
As the sensor may not be able to correctly detect these types of vehicles, the approach
warning (P. 250) will not be activated, which may lead to an accident resulting in
death or serious injury.
● Vehicles that cut in suddenly
● Vehicles traveling at low speeds
● Vehicles that are not moving in the same lane
● Vehicles with small rear ends (trailers with no load on board, etc.)

● Motorcycles traveling in the same lane
● When water or snow thrown up by the surrounding vehicles hinders the detecting of

the sensor

WARNING

● When your vehicle is pointing upwards
(caused by a heavy load in the luggage com-
partment, etc.)

■ Conditions under which the vehicle-to-vehicle distance control mode may not func-
tion correctly
Operate the brake pedal (or accelerator pedal operation depending on the situation)
as necessary in the following conditions as the radar sensor may not be able to cor-
rectly detect vehicles ahead, which may lead to an accident resulting in death or seri-
ous injury.

WARNING

■ Handling the radar sensor
Observe the following to ensure the dynamic radar cruise control with full-speed
range can function effectively.
Otherwise, the radar sensor may not detect correctly and could result in an accident.
● Keep the sensor and grille cover clean at all times.

Clean the sensor and grille cover with a soft cloth so you do not mark or damage
them.

● Do not subject the sensor or surrounding area to a strong impact.
If the sensor moves even slightly off position, the system may malfunction. If the sen-
sor or surrounding area is subject to a strong impact, always have the area inspected
and adjusted by your Lexus dealer.

● Do not disassemble the sensor.
● Do not attach accessories or stickers to the sensor, grille cover or surrounding area.

■ Buzzer operation and distance to an obstacle
A buzzer sounds when the sensors are operating.
● The buzzer sounds faster as the vehicle approaches an obstacle. 

When the vehicle comes within the following distance of the obstacle, the
buzzer sounds continuously.
• Front corner sensors: Approximately 1.0 ft. (30 cm)
• Front center sensors: Approximately 1.0 ft. (30 cm)
• Rear corner sensors: Approximately 1.0 ft. (30 cm)
• Rear center sensors: Approximately 1.2 ft. (35 cm)

● When 2 or more obstacles are detected simultaneously, the buzzer system
responds to the nearest obstacle. If one or both come within the above dis-
tances, the beep will repeat a long tone, followed by fast beeps.

Detection range of the sensors
1 Approximately 3.3 ft. (100 cm) 4
2 Approximately 4.9 ft. (150 cm)
3 Approximately 2.0 ft. (60 cm)

● Front corner sensors:

• The engine switch is in IGNITION ON mode.
• The shift lever is in other than P.
• The vehicle speed is less than about 6 mph (10 km/h).

(At any speed when the shift lever is in R)
● Front center sensors:

• The engine switch is in IGNITION ON mode.
• The shift lever is in other than P or R.
• The vehicle speed is less than about 6 mph (10 km/h).

● Rear corner and rear center sensors:
• The engine switch is in IGNITION ON mode.
• The shift lever is in R.

■ Intuitive parking assist display
When an obstacle is detected while the Lexus parking assist monitor is in use, the warn-
ing indicator will appear in the upper corner of the screen even if the display setting has
been set to off.

■ Sensor detection information 4
● The sensor’s detection areas are limited to the areas around the vehicle’s bumper.
● Certain vehicle conditions and the surrounding environment may affect the ability of a

sensor to correctly detect an obstacle. Particular instances where this may occur are
listed below.
• There is dirt, snow or ice on the sensor. (Wiping the sensors will resolve this prob-

lem.)
• The sensor is frozen. (Thawing the area will resolve this problem.)

In especially cold weather, if a sensor is frozen the screen may show an abnormal
display, or obstacles may not be detected.

• The sensor is covered in any way.
• The vehicle is leaning considerably to one side.
• On an extremely bumpy road, on an incline, on gravel, or on grass.
• The vicinity of the vehicle is noisy due to vehicle horns, motorcycle engines, air

brakes of large vehicles, or other loud noises producing ultrasonic waves.
• There is another vehicle equipped with parking assist sensors in the vicinity.
• The sensor is coated with a sheet of spray or heavy rain.
• The vehicle is equipped with a fender pole or wireless antenna.
• Towing eyelets are installed.
• The bumper or sensor receives a strong impact.
• The vehicle is approaching a tall or curved curb.
• In harsh sunlight or intense cold weather.
• The area directly under the bumpers is not detected.
• If obstacles draw too close to the sensor.
• A non-genuine Lexus suspension (lowered suspension etc.) is installed.
• People may not be detected if they are wearing certain types of clothing.
In addition to the examples above, there are instances in which, because of their shape,
signs and other objects may be judged by a sensor to be closer than they are.

NX200t_OM_USA_OM78081U

Driving



276 4-5. Using the driving support systems

● The shape of the obstacle may prevent a sensor from detecting it. Pay particular atten-
tion to the following obstacles:
• Wires, fences, ropes, etc.
• Cotton, snow and other materials that absorb sound waves
• Sharply-angled objects
• Low obstacles
• Tall obstacles with upper sections projecting outwards in the direction of your vehi-

cle
● The following situations may occur during use.

• Depending on the shape of the obstacle and other factors, the detection distance
may shorten, or detection may be impossible.

• Obstacles may not be detected if they are too close to the sensor.
• There will be a short delay between obstacle detection and display. Even at slow

speeds, there is a possibility that the obstacle will come within the sensor’s detection
areas before the display is shown and the buzzer sounds.

• Thin posts or objects lower than the sensor may not be detected when approached,
even if they have been detected once.

• It might be difficult to hear beeps due to the volume of audio system or air flow noise
of the air conditioning system.

■ If “Clean Parking Assist Sensor” is displayed on the multi-information display
A sensor may be dirty or covered with snow or ice. In such cases, if it is removed from the
sensor, the system should return to normal. 
Also, due to the sensor being frozen at low temperatures, a malfunction display may
appear or an obstacle may not be detected. If the sensor thaws out, the system should
return to normal.

■ If “Parking Assist Malfunction” is displayed on the multi-information display
Depending on the malfunction of the sensor, the device may not be working normally.
Have the vehicle inspected by your Lexus dealer.

■ Certification

■ When using the intuitive parking assist
Observe the following precautions.
Failing to do so may result in the vehicle being unable to be driven safely and possibly
cause an accident.
● Do not use the sensor at speeds in excess of 6 mph (10 km/h).
● The sensors’ detection areas and reaction times are limited. When moving forward or

reversing, check the areas surrounding the vehicle (especially the sides of the vehi-
cle) for safety, and drive slowly, using the brake to control the vehicle’s speed.

● Do not install accessories within the sensors’ detection areas.

NOTICE

■ When using intuitive parking assist
In the following situations, the system may not function correctly due to a sensor mal-
function, etc. Have the vehicle checked by your Lexus dealer. 4
● The intuitive parking assist operation display flashes, and a buzzer sounds when no

obstacles are detected.
● If the area around a sensor collides with something, or is subjected to strong impact.
● If the bumper collides with something.
● If the display shows continuously without beeping, except when the buzzer mute

switch has been turned on.
● If a display error occurs, first check the sensor.

If the error occurs even if there is no ice, snow or mud on the sensor, it is likely that the

WARNING

■ When using the Lexus parking assist monitor system
The parking assist monitor is a supplemental device intended to assist the driver when
backing up. When backing up, be sure to check visually behind and all around the vehi-
cle before proceeding.
Observe the following precautions to avoid an accident that could result in death or
serious injuries.
● Never depend on the parking assist monitor entirely when backing up. The image

and the position of the guide lines displayed on the screen may differ from the actual
state.
Use caution, just as you would when backing up any vehicle.

● Be sure to back up slowly, depressing the brake pedal to control vehicle speed.
● If you seem likely to hit nearby vehicles, obstacles, people or mount the shoulder,

depress the brake pedal to stop the vehicle.
● The instructions given are only guidelines.

When and how much to turn the steering wheel will vary according to traffic condi-
tions, road surface conditions, vehicle condition, etc. when parking. It is necessary to
be fully aware of this before using the parking assist system. 

● When parking, be sure to check that the parking space will accommodate your vehi-
cle before maneuvering into it.

● Do not use the parking assist monitor in the following cases:
• On icy or slick road surfaces, or in snow
• When using tire chains or emergency tires
• When the back door is not closed completely
• On roads that are not flat or straight, such as curves or slopes.

● In low temperatures, the screen may darken or the image may become faint. The
image could distort when the vehicle is moving, or you may become unable to see the
image on the screen. Be sure to check direct visually and with the mirrors all around
the vehicle before proceeding.

● If the tire sizes are changed, the position of the guide lines displayed on the screen
may change.

● The camera uses a special lens. The distances between objects and pedestrians that
appear in the image displayed on the screen will differ from the actual distances. 
(P. 286)

● Estimated course line display mode: If the steering wheel is straight and the vehicle
width guide lines and the estimated course lines are not in alignment, have the vehicle
inspected by your Lexus dealer.

change.

• As the camera has a water proof construction, do not detach, disassemble or
modify it. This may cause incorrect operation.

• When cleaning the camera lens, flush the camera with a large quantity of water
and wipe it with a soft and wet cloth. Strongly rubbing the camera lens may cause
the camera lens to be scratched and unable to transmit a clear image.

• Do not allow organic solvent, car wax, window cleaner or glass coat to adhere to
the camera. If this happens, wipe it off as soon as possible.

• If the temperature changes rapidly, such as when hot water is poured on the vehi-
cle in cold weather, the system may not operate normally.

• When washing the vehicle, do not apply intensive bursts of water to the camera or
camera area. Doing so may result in the camera malfunctioning.

● Do not expose the camera to strong impact as this could cause a malfunction. 
If this happens, have the vehicle inspected by your Lexus dealer as soon as possible. 4

Driving assist systems

To help enhance driving safety and performance, the following systems oper-
ate automatically in response to various driving situations. Be aware, however,
that these systems are supplementary and should not be relied upon too
heavily when operating the vehicle. 

◆ ABS (Anti-lock Brake System)

Helps to prevent wheel lock when the brakes are applied suddenly, or if the
brakes are applied while driving on a slippery road surface

◆ Brake assist

Generates an increased level of braking force after the brake pedal is
depressed when the system detects a panic stop situation

4
◆ VSC (Vehicle Stability Control)

Helps the driver to control skidding when swerving suddenly or turning on
slippery road surfaces

◆ Enhanced VSC (Enhanced Vehicle Stability Control)

Provides cooperative control of the ABS, TRAC, VSC and EPS.
Helps to maintain directional stability when swerving on slippery road sur-
faces by controlling steering performance.

◆ TRAC (Traction Control) 

Helps to maintain drive power and prevent the drive wheels from spinning
when starting the vehicle or accelerating on slippery roads

◆ Hill-start assist control

Helps to prevent the vehicle from rolling backward when starting on an
incline.

◆ EPS (Electric Power Steering) 

Employs an electric motor to reduce the amount of effort needed to turn the
steering wheel

◆ Dynamic Torque Control AWD system (if equipped)

Automatically switches from front-wheel drive to all-wheel drive (AWD)
according to the driving conditions, helping to ensure reliable handling and
stability. Examples of conditions where the system will switch to AWD are
when cornering, going uphill, starting off or accelerating, and when the road
surface is slippery due to snow, rain, etc.

◆ AVS (Adaptive Variable Suspension system) (if equipped)

By independently controlling the damping force of the shock absorbers for
each of the 4 wheels according to the road and driving conditions, this system
helps riding comfort with superior steering stability, and helps good vehicle
posture. When SPORT S+ mode is selected by the driving mode select
switch, the damping force is suitable for sporty driving. (P. 295)

■ Sounds and vibrations caused by the ABS, brake assist, TRAC, VSC and hill-start assist
control systems
● A sound may be heard from the engine compartment when the brake pedal is

depressed repeatedly, when the engine is started or just after the vehicle begins to
move. This sound does not indicate that a malfunction has occurred in any of these sys-
tems.

● Any of the following conditions may occur when the above systems are operating.
None of these indicates that a malfunction has occurred. 

• Vibrations may be felt through the vehicle body and steering.
• A motor sound may be heard after the vehicle comes to a stop.
• The brake pedal may pulsate slightly after the ABS is activated.
• The brake pedal may move down slightly after the ABS is activated.

■ EPS operation sound
When the steering wheel is operated, a motor sound (whirring sound) may be heard.
This does not indicate a malfunction.

■ Reduced effectiveness of the EPS system
The effectiveness of the EPS system is reduced to prevent the system from overheating
when there is frequent steering input over an extended period of time. The steering
wheel may feel heavy as a result. Should this occur, refrain from excessive steering input
or stop the vehicle and turn the engine off. The EPS system should return to normal
within 10 minutes.

■ Automatic reactivation of TRAC and VSC systems
After turning the TRAC and VSC systems off, the systems will be automatically
re-enabled in the following situations:
● When the engine switch is turned off
● If only the TRAC system is turned off, the TRAC will turn on when vehicle speed

increases
If both the TRAC and VSC systems are turned off, automatic re-enabling will not
occur when vehicle speed increases.

■ Operating conditions of hill-start assist control
When the following four conditions are met, the hill-start assist control will operate:
● The shift lever is in a position other than P or N (when starting off forward/backward on

an upward incline).
● The vehicle is stopped.
● The accelerator pedal is not depressed.
● The parking brake is not engaged.

■ Automatic system cancelation of hill-start assist control

■ The ABS does not operate effectively when
● The limits of tire gripping performance have been exceeded (such as excessively

worn tires on a snow covered road).
● The vehicle hydroplanes while driving at high speed on wet or slick road.

■ Stopping distance when the ABS is operating may exceed that of normal conditions
The ABS is not designed to shorten the vehicle’s stopping distance. Always maintain a
safe distance from the vehicle in front of you, especially in the following situations:
● When driving on dirt, gravel or snow-covered roads
● When driving with tire chains
● When driving over bumps in the road
● When driving over roads with potholes or uneven surfaces

■ TRAC may not operate effectively when
Directional control and power may not be achievable while driving on slippery road
surfaces, even if the TRAC system is operating. 
Drive the vehicle carefully in conditions where stability and power may be lost. 4

■ Hill-start assist control does not operate effectively when
● Do not overly rely on the hill-start assist control. The hill-start assist control may not

operate effectively on steep inclines and roads covered with ice.
● Unlike the parking brake, hill-start assist control is not intended to hold the vehicle

stationary for an extended period of time. Do not attempt to use hill-start assist con-
trol to hold the vehicle on an incline, as doing so may lead to an accident. 

■ When the TRAC/VSC are activated
The slip indicator light flashes. Always drive carefully. Reckless driving may cause an
accident. Exercise particular care when the indicator light flashes.

■ When the TRAC/VSC systems are turned off
Be especially careful and drive at a speed appropriate to the road conditions. As these
are the systems to help ensure vehicle stability and driving force, do not turn the
TRAC/VSC systems off unless necessary.

■ Replacing tires
Make sure that all tires are of the specified size, brand, tread pattern and total load
capacity. In addition, make sure that the tires are inflated to the recommended tire infla-
tion pressure level.
The ABS, TRAC and VSC systems will not function correctly if different tires are
installed on the vehicle.
Contact your Lexus dealer for further information when replacing tires or wheels.

■ Handling of tires and the suspension
Using tires with any kind of problem or modifying the suspension will affect the driving
assist systems, and may cause a system to malfunction.

◆ Pre-collision brake assist

When there is a high possibility of a frontal collision, the system applies greater brak-
ing force in relation to how strongly the brake pedal is depressed.

◆ Pre-collision braking

When there is a high possibility of a frontal collision, the system warns the driver using
warning display and buzzer. If the system determines that a collision is unavoidable,
the brakes are automatically applied to reduce the collision speed.

◆ Suspension control (vehicles with Adaptive Variable Suspension system)

WARNING

■ Limitations of the pre-collision system
The driver is solely responsible for safe driving. Always drive safely, taking care to
observe your surroundings.
Do not use the pre-collision system instead of normal braking operations under any
circumstances. This system will not prevent collisions or lessen damage or injuries in all
cases. Do not overly rely on this system. Failure to do so may cause an accident, result-
ing in death or serious injury.
This system has been designed to help avoid and reduce the impact of collisions. 
However, the system operates differently depending on the situation. (P. 305) 
As a result, the same level of performance may not be expected in all cases. Also, the
pre-collision system brakes may not operate if the driver is depressing the brake pedal
or turning the steering wheel, as the system will determine such conditions as collision 4
avoidance operations.

■ Handling the radar sensor
Observe the following to ensure the pre-collision system can function effectively.
Otherwise, the system may not function correctly and could result in an accident.
● Keep the sensor and front grille cover clean at all times.

Clean the sensor and front grille cover with a soft cloth so you do not mark or dam-
age them.

● Do not subject the sensor or surrounding area to a strong impact.
If the sensor moves even slightly off position, the system may not normally or malfunc-
tion. If the sensor or surrounding area is subject to a strong impact, always have the
area inspected and adjusted by your Lexus dealer.

● Do not disassemble the sensor.
● Do not attach accessories or stickers to the sensor, grille cover or surrounding area.
● Do not modify or paint the sensor and grille cover.
● If the radar sensor needs to be replaced, contact your Lexus dealer.

WARNING

■ Cautions regarding the assist contents of the system
By means of alarms and brake control, the pre-collision system is intended to assist the
driver in avoiding collisions through the process of LOOK-JUDGE-ACT. There are
limits to the degree of assistance the system can provide, so please keep in mind the
following important points.
● Assisting the driver in watching the road

The pre-collision system is only able to detect obstacles directly in front of the vehicle,
and only within a limited range. It is not a mechanism that allows careless or inatten-
tive driving, and it is not a system that can assist the driver in low-visibility conditions. It
is still necessary for the driver to pay close attention to the vehicle’s surroundings.

● Assisting the driver in making correct judgement
When attempting to estimate the possibility of a collision, the only data available to
the pre-collision system is that from obstacles it has detected directly in front of the
vehicle. Therefore, it is absolutely necessary for the driver to remain vigilant and to
determine whether or not there is a possibility of collision in any given situation.

● Assisting the driver in taking action
The pre-collision system’s braking assist feature is designed to help reduce the sever-
ity of a collision, and so only acts when the system has judged that a collision is
unavoidable. This system is not capable of automatically avoiding a collision or bring-
ing the vehicle to a stop safely without appropriate operations performed by the
driver.
For this reason, when encountering a dangerous situation the driver must take direct
and immediate action in order to ensure the safety of all involved.

Winter driving tips

Carry out the necessary preparations and inspections before driving the vehi-
cle in winter. Always drive the vehicle in a manner appropriate to the prevail-
ing weather conditions. 

Preparation for winter
● Use fluids that are appropriate to the prevailing outside temperatures. 

• Engine oil
• Engine coolant
• Washer fluid

● Have a service technician inspect the condition of the battery.
● Have the vehicle fitted with four snow tires or purchase a set of tire chains for

the front tires*. 4

Ensure that all tires are the same size and brand, and that chains match the size of the
tires.

*: Tire chains cannot be mounted on the 225/60R18 tires.

Before driving the vehicle
Perform the following according to the driving conditions:
● Do not try to forcibly open a window or move a wiper that is frozen. Pour

warm water over the frozen area to melt the ice. Wipe away the water imme-
diately to prevent it from freezing. 

● To ensure proper operation of the climate control system fan, remove any
snow that has accumulated on the air inlet vents in front of the windshield. 

● Check for and remove any excess ice or snow that may have accumulated on
the exterior lights, vehicle’s roof, chassis, around the tires or on the brakes.

● Remove any snow or mud from the bottom of your shoes before getting in the
vehicle.

When driving the vehicle
Accelerate the vehicle slowly, keep a safe distance between you and the vehicle
ahead, and drive at a reduced speed suitable to road conditions.

When parking the vehicle
● Park the vehicle and move the shift lever to P and block the wheel under the

vehicle without setting the parking brake. The parking brake may freeze up,
preventing it from being released.
When the parking brake is in automatic mode, release the parking brake after shifting
the shift lever to P. (P. 204)

● If the vehicle is left parked with the brakes damp in cold temperatures, there is
a possibility of the brakes freezing.

Selecting tire chains
Use the correct tire chain size when mounting the tire chains. Chain size is regu-
lated for each tire size.
 Vehicles with 225/65R17 and 235/55R18 tires
Side chain:
1 3 mm (0.12 in.) in diameter
2 10 mm (0.39 in.) in width
3 25 mm (0.98 in.) in length
Cross chain:
4 4 mm (0.16 in.) in diameter
5 14 mm (0.55 in.) in width
6 25 mm (0.98 in.) in length
 Vehicles with 225/60R18 tires
Tire chains cannot be mounted on the 225/60R18 tires. Snow tires should be
use instead.

Regulations on the use of tire chains
Regulations regarding the use of tire chains vary depending on location and type
of road. Always check local regulations before installing chains.

NX200t_OM_USA_OM78081U



4-6. Driving tips 319

■ Tire chain installation
Observe the following precautions when installing and removing chains:
● Install and remove tire chains in a safe location. 
● Install tire chains on the front tires only. Do not install tire chains on the rear tires.
● Install tire chains on front tires as tightly as possible. Retighten chains after driving

1/4 - 1/2 mile (0.5 - 1.0 km).
● Install tire chains following the instructions provided with the tire chains. 

WARNING

■ Driving with snow tires
Observe the following precautions to reduce the risk of accidents. 
Failure to do so may result in a loss of vehicle control and cause death or serious injury.
● Use tires of the specified size.
● Maintain the recommended level of air pressure.
● Do not drive in excess of 75 mph (120 km/h), regardless of the type of snow tires

being used. 4
● Use snow tires on all, not just some wheels.

■ Driving with tire chains
Observe the following precautions to reduce the risk of accidents. 
Failure to do so may result in the vehicle being unable to be driven safely, and may
cause death or serious injury.
● Do not drive in excess of the speed limit specified for the tire chains being used, or

30 mph (50 km/h), whichever is lower.
● Avoid driving on bumpy road surfaces or over potholes.
● Avoid sudden acceleration, abrupt steering, sudden braking and shifting operations

that cause sudden engine braking.
● Slow down sufficiently before entering a curve to ensure that vehicle control is main-

tained.
■ When parking the vehicle

When parking the vehicle without applying the parking brake, make sure to chock the
wheels. If you do not chock the wheels, the vehicle may move unexpectedly, possibly
resulting in an accident.

NOTICE

■ Repairing or replacing snow tires
Request repairs or replacement of snow tires from Lexus dealers or legitimate tire
retailers.
This is because the removal and attachment of snow tires affects the operation of the
tire pressure warning valves and transmitters.

■ Fitting tire chains
The tire pressure warning valves and transmitters may not function correctly when tire
chains are fitted.

Utility vehicle precautions

This vehicle belongs to the utility vehicle class, which has higher ground clear-
ance and narrower tread in relation to the height of its center of gravity.

Utility vehicle feature
● Specific design characteristics give it a higher center of gravity than ordinary

passenger cars. This vehicle design feature causes this type of vehicle to be
more likely to rollover. Utility vehicles have a significantly higher rollover rate
than other types of vehicles.

● An advantage of the higher ground clearance is a better view of the road
allowing you to anticipate problems.

● It is not designed for cornering at the same speeds as ordinary passenger cars
any more than low-slung sports cars designed to perform satisfactorily under 4
off-road conditions. Therefore, sharp turns at excessive speeds may cause
rollover.

WARNING

■ Utility vehicle precautions
Always observe the following precautions to minimize the risk of death or serious
injury or damage to your vehicle:
● In a rollover crash, an unbelted person is significantly more likely to die than a person

wearing a seat belt. Therefore, the driver and all passengers should always fasten
their seat belts.

● Avoid sharp turns or abrupt maneuvers, if at all possible.
Failure to operate this vehicle correctly may result in loss of control or vehicle rollover
causing death or serious injury.

● Loading cargo on the roof luggage carrier (if equipped) will make the center of the
vehicle gravity higher. Avoid high speeds, sudden starts, sharp turns, sudden braking
or abrupt maneuvers, otherwise it may result in loss of control or vehicle rollover due
to failure to operate this vehicle correctly.

● Always slow down in gusty crosswinds. Because of its profile and higher center of
gravity, your vehicle is more sensitive to side winds than an ordinary passenger car.
Slowing down will allow you to have better control.

● Do not drive horizontally across steep slopes. Driving straight up or straight down is
preferred. Your vehicle (or any similar off-road vehicle) can tip over sideways much
more easily than forward or backward.

322 4-6. Driving tips

Off-road driving
Your vehicle is not designed to be driven off-road. However, in the event that
off-road driving cannot be avoided, please observe the following precautions to
help avoid the areas prohibited to vehicles.
● Drive your vehicle only in areas where off-road vehicles are permitted to

travel.
● Respect private property. Get owner’s permission before entering private

property.
● Do not enter areas that are closed. Honor gates, barriers and signs that

restrict travel.
● Stay on established roads. When conditions are wet, driving techniques

should be changed or travel delayed to prevent damage to roads.

■ Additional information for off-road driving
 For owners in U.S. mainland, Hawaii and Puerto Rico:
To obtain additional information pertaining to driving your vehicle off-road, consult the
following organizations.
● State and Local Parks and Recreation Departments
● State Motor Vehicle Bureau
● Recreational Vehicle Clubs
● U.S. Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management

WARNING

■ Off-road driving precautions
Always observe the following precautions to minimize the risk of death or serious
injury or damage to your vehicle:
● Drive carefully when off the road. Do not take unnecessary risks by driving in danger-

ous places.
● Do not grip the steering wheel spokes when driving off-road. A bad bump could jerk

the wheel and injure your hands. Keep both hands and especially your thumbs on the
outside of the rim.

● Always check your brakes for effectiveness immediately after driving in sand, mud,
water or snow.

● After driving through tall grass, mud, rock, sand, water, etc., check that there is no
grass, bush, paper, rags, stone, sand, etc. adhering or trapped to the underbody.
Clear off any such matter from the underbody. If the vehicle is used with these materi-
als trapped or adhering to the underbody, a breakdown or fire could occur.

● When driving off-road or in rugged terrain, do not drive at excessive speeds, jump,
make sharp turns, strike objects, etc. This may cause loss of control or vehicle rollover
causing death or serious injury. You are also risking expensive damage to your vehi-
cle’s suspension and chassis.

NX200t_OM_USA_OM78081U



4-6. Driving tips 323

NOTICE

■ To prevent water damage
Take all necessary safety measures to ensure that water damage to the engine or other
components does not occur.
● Water entering the engine air intake will cause severe engine damage.
● Water entering the automatic transmission will cause deterioration in shift quality,

locking up of your transmission accompanied by vibration, and ultimately damage.
● Water can wash the grease from wheel bearings, causing rusting and premature fail-

ure, and may also enter the differentials, transmission and transfer case, reducing the
gear oil’s lubricating qualities.

■ When you drive through water
If driving through water, such as when crossing shallow streams, first check the depth of
the water and the bottom of the riverbed for firmness. Drive slowly and avoid deep
water.

■ Inspection after off-road driving
● Sand and mud that has accumulated around brake discs may affect braking efficiency

and may damage brake system components. 4
● Always perform a maintenance inspection after each day of off-road driving that has

taken you through rough terrain, sand, mud, or water. For scheduled maintenance
information, refer to the “Warranty and Services Guide/Owner’s Manual Supple-
ment/Scheduled Maintenance”.

HD Radio™ Technology
HD Radio™ Technology is the digital evolution of analog AM/FM radio. Your
radio product has a special receiver which allows it to receive digital broadcasts
(where available) in addition to the analog broadcasts it already receives.
Digital broadcasts have better sound quality than analog broadcasts as digital
broadcasts provide free, crystal clear audio with no static or distortion. For more
information, and a guide to available radio stations and programming, refer to
www.hdradio.com.
“HD Radio features included in Lexus radios: 
Digital Sound - HD Radio broadcasts deliver crystal-clear, digital audio quality to
listeners. 
HD2/HD3 Channels - FM stations can provide additional digital only audio pro-
gramming with expanded content and format choices on HD2/HD3 channels.
PSD - Program Service Data (PSD) gives you on-screen information such as art-
ist name and song title. 
iTunes Tagging - Listeners can tag (store) songs they like for later review and pur-
chase through iTunes. 5
Artist Experience - Images related to the broadcast are displayed on the radio
screen, such as album cover art and station logos.”

■ Reception sensitivity
● Maintaining perfect radio reception at all times is difficult due to the continually chang-

ing position of the antenna, differences in signal strength and surrounding objects, such
as trains, transmitters, etc.

● The radio antenna is mounted inside the rear window. To maintain clear radio reception,
do not attach metallic window tinting or other metallic objects to the antenna wire
mounted inside the rear window.

● File names
The only files that can be recognized as MP3/WMA/AAC and played are those with
the extension .mp3, .wma or .m4a.

● Discs containing multi-session recordings
As the audio system is compatible with multi session discs, it is possible to play discs
that contain MP3, WMA and AAC files. However, only the first session can be played.

● ID3, WMA and AAC tags
ID3 tags can be added to MP3 files, making it possible to record the track title, artist
name, etc.
The system is compatible with ID3 Ver. 1.0, 1.1, and Ver. 2.2, 2.3 ID3 tags. (The number
of characters is based on ID3 Ver. 1.0 and 1.1.)
WMA tags can be added to WMA files, making it possible to record the track title and
artist name in the same way as with ID3 tags.
AAC tags can be added to AAC files, making it possible to record the track title and
artist name in the same way as with ID3 tags.

● MP3, WMA and AAC playback
When a disc containing MP3, WMA or AAC files is inserted, all files on the disc are
first checked. Once the file check is finished, the first MP3, WMA or AAC file is
played. To make the file check finish more quickly, we recommend you do not write any
files to the disc other than MP3, WMA or AAC files or create any unnecessary fold-
ers.
Discs that contain a mixture of music data and MP3, WMA or AAC format data can-
not be played.

● Extensions
If the file extensions .mp3, .wma and .m4a are used for files other than MP3, WMA
and AAC files, they may be mistakenly recognized and played as MP3, WMA and
AAC files. This may result in large amounts of interference and damage to the speak-
ers.

● Playback
• To play MP3 files with steady sound quality, we recommend a fixed bit rate of at least

128 kbps and a sampling frequency of 44.1 kHz.
• CD-R or CD-RW playback may not be possible in some instances, depending on

the characteristics of the disc.
• There is a wide variety of freeware and other encoding software for MP3, WMA

and AAC files on the market, and depending on the status of the encoding and the
file format, poor sound quality or noise at the start of playback may result. In some
cases, playback may not be possible at all.

• When files other than MP3, WMA or AAC files are recorded on a disc, it may take
more time to recognize the disc and in some cases, playback may not be possible at
all.

Microsoft Corporation in the U.S.A. and other countries.

● MP3, WMA and AAC playback
• When a device containing MP3, WMA or AAC files is connected, all files in the

USB memory device are checked. Once the file check is finished, the first MP3,
WMA or AAC file is played. To make the file check finish more quickly, we recom-
mend that you do not include any files other than MP3, WMA or AAC files or cre-
ate any unnecessary folders.

• When a USB memory device is connected and the audio source is changed to USB
memory mode, the USB memory device will start playing the first file in the first
folder. If the same device is removed and reconnected (and the contents have not
been changed), the USB memory device will resume play from the same point in
which it was last used.

● Extensions
If the file extensions .mp3, .wma and .m4a are used for files other than MP3, WMA
and AAC files, they will be skipped (not played).

● Playback
• To play MP3 files with steady sound quality, we recommend a fixed bit rate of at least

128 kbps and a sampling frequency of 44.1 kHz.
• There is a wide variety of freeware and other encoding software for MP3, WMA

and AAC files on the market, and depending on the status of the encoding and the
file format, poor sound quality or noise at the start of playback may result. In some
cases, playback may not be possible at all.

■ Fogging up of the windows
● The windows will easily fog up when the humidity in the vehicle is high. Pressing “A/C”

button or selecting “A/C” will dehumidify the air from the outlets and defog the wind-
shield effectively. 

● If you turn “A/C” off, the windows may fog up more easily.
● The windows may fog up if the recirculated air mode is used.

■ Windshield fog detection function (vehicles with a humidity sensor)
When automatic mode is set, the humidity sensor (P. 429) detects fog on the wind-
shield and controls the air conditioning system to prevent fog.

■ Outside/recirculated air mode

● When driving on dusty roads such as tunnels or in heavy traffic, set  to
the recirculated air mode. This is effective in preventing outside air from entering the
vehicle interior. During cooling operation, setting the recirculated air mode will also
cool the vehicle interior effectively.

● Outside/recirculated air mode may automatically switch depending on the tempera-
ture setting or the inside temperature.

■ When the outside temperature is low
The dehumidification function may not operate even when “A/C” is pressed or “A/C” is
selected.

■ Operation of the air conditioning system in Eco drive mode
● In the Eco drive mode, the air conditioning system is controlled as follows to prioritize

fuel efficiency
• Engine speed and compressor operation controlled to restrict heating/cooling

capacity
• Fan speed restricted when automatic mode is selected

● To improve air conditioning performance, perform the following operations
• Adjust the fan speed
• Turn off Eco drive mode

■ Ventilation and air conditioning odors
● To let fresh air in, set the air conditioning system to the outside air mode.
● During use, various odors from inside and outside the vehicle may enter into and accu-

mulate in the air conditioning system. This may then cause odor to be emitted from the
vents.

● To reduce potential odors from occurring: 
• It is recommended that the air conditioning system be set to outside air mode prior

to turning the vehicle off.
• The start timing of the blower may be delayed for a short period of time immediately

after the air conditioning system is started in automatic mode.

6-1. Using the air conditioning system and defogger 429

WARNING

■ To prevent the windshield from fogging up

● Do not use  during cool air operation in extremely humid weather. The differ-
ence between the temperature of the outside air and that of the windshield can cause
the outer surface of the windshield to fog up, blocking your vision.

● Do not place anything on the instrument
panel which may cover the air outlets. Other-
wise, air flow may be obstructed, preventing
the windshield defoggers from defogging.

■ To prevent burns
● Do not touch the rear view mirror surfaces when the outside rear view mirror defog-

gers are on.
● Vehicles with windshield wiper de-icer: Do not touch the glass at lower part of the

windshield or to the side of the front pillars when the windshield wiper de-icer is on.

NOTICE

■ Humidity sensor (if equipped)
In order to detect fog on the windshield, a sen-
sor which monitors the temperature of the
windshield, the surround humidity, etc., is
installed. (P. 428)
Follow these points to avoid damaging the sen-
sor:
● Do not disassemble the sensor
● Do not spray the glass cleaner on the sensor

or subject it to strong impacts 
● Do not stick anything on the sensor

■ To prevent battery discharge
Do not leave the air conditioning system on longer than necessary when the engine is

receives the vehicle’s location and attempts to speak with the vehicle occu-
pants to assess the level of emergency. If the occupants are unable to commu-
nicate, the agent automatically treats the call as an emergency, contacts the
nearest emergency services provider to describe the situation, and requests
that assistance be sent to the location.

■ Stolen Vehicle Location
If your vehicle is stolen, Safety Connect can work with local authorities to
assist them in locating and recovering the vehicle. After filing a police report,
call the Safety Connect response center at 1-800-25-LEXUS
(1-800-255-3987) and follow the prompts for Safety Connect to initiate this
service. 
In addition to assisting law enforcement with recovery of a stolen vehicle,
Safety-Connect-equipped vehicle location data may, under certain circum-
stances, be shared with third parties to locate your vehicle. Further informa-
tion is available at Lexus.com.

■ Emergency Assistance Button (“SOS”) 6

In the event of an emergency on the road, push the “SOS” button to reach the
Safety Connect response center. The answering agent will determine your
vehicle’s location, assess the emergency, and dispatch the necessary assis-
tance required.

If you accidentally press the “SOS” button, tell the response-center agent that you
are not experiencing an emergency.

■ Enhanced Roadside Assistance 
Enhanced Roadside Assistance adds GPS data to the already included war-
ranty-based Lexus roadside service.
Subscribers can press the “SOS” button to reach a Safety Connect response-
center agent, who can help with a wide range of needs, such as: towing, flat
tire, fuel delivery, etc. For a description of the Roadside Assistance services

Safety information for Safety Connect
Important! Read this information before using Safety Connect.
■ Exposure to radio frequency signals

The Safety Connect system installed in your vehicle is a low-power radio
transmitter and receiver. It receives and also sends out radio frequency (RF)
signals.
In August 1996, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) adopted
RF exposure guidelines with safety levels for mobile wireless phones. Those
guidelines are consistent with the safety standards previously set by the fol-
lowing U.S. and international standards bodies.
● ANSI (American National Standards Institute) C95.1 [1992]
● NCRP (National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurement)

Report 86 [1986]
● ICNIRP (International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection)

[1996]
Those standards were based on comprehensive and periodic evaluations of
the relevant scientific literature. Over 120 scientists, engineers, and physi-
cians from universities, and government health agencies and industries
reviewed the available body of research to develop the ANSI Standard
(C95.1).
The design of Safety Connect complies with the FCC guidelines in addition to
those standards.

Cleaning and protecting the vehicle exterior

Perform the following to protect the vehicle and maintain it in prime condi-
tion:

● Working from top to bottom, liberally apply water to the vehicle body, wheel
wells and underside of the vehicle to remove any dirt and dust.

● Wash the vehicle body using a sponge or soft cloth, such as a chamois.
● For hard-to-remove marks, use car wash soap and rinse thoroughly with

water.
● Wipe away any water.
● Wax the vehicle when the waterproof coating deteriorates.

If water does not bead on a clean surface, apply wax when the vehicle body is cool.

■ Self-restoring coat
The vehicle body has a self-restoring coating that is resistant to small surface scratches
caused in a car wash etc.
● The coating lasts for 5 to 8 years after the coating has been performed.
● The restoration time differs depending on the depth of the scratch and outside temper-

ature. The restoration time may become shorter when the coating is warmed by apply-
ing warm water.

● Deep scratches caused by keys or coins cannot be restored.
● Do not use wax that contain abrasives.

■ Automatic car washes
● Before washing the vehicle:

• Fold the mirrors
• Turn off the power back door (if equipped)
Start washing from the front of the vehicle. Extend the mirrors before driving.

Tire pressure warning system
Your vehicle is equipped with a tire pressure warning system that uses tire pres-
sure warning valves and transmitters to detect low tire inflation pressure before
serious problems arise.
● If the tire pressure drops below a predetermined level, the driver is warned by

a warning light. (P. 552)
● The tire pressure detected by the tire

pressure warning system can be dis-
played on the multi-information display.

◆ Installing tire pressure warning valves and transmitters

When replacing tires or wheels, tire pressure warning valves and transmitters
must also be installed.
When new tire pressure warning valves and transmitters are installed, new ID
codes must be registered in the tire pressure warning computer and the tire
pressure warning system must be initialized. Have tire pressure warning valve
and transmitter ID codes registered by your Lexus dealer. (P. 505)

◆ Initializing the tire pressure warning system
7

■ The tire pressure warning system must be initialized in the following circum-
stances:
● When adjusting the tire inflation pressure
● When the tire inflation pressure is changed such as when changing travel-

ing speed.
● When rotating the tires
● When changing the tire.
When the tire pressure warning system is initialized, the current tire inflation
pressure is set as the benchmark pressure.

7 A message and an indicator are
displayed by the multi-informa-
tion display, and initialization is
completed.

◆ Registering ID codes

The tire pressure warning valve and transmitter is equipped with a unique ID
code. When replacing a tire pressure warning valve and transmitter, it is nec-
essary to register the ID code. Have the ID code registered by your Lexus
dealer.

■ When to replace your vehicle’s tires
Tires should be replaced if:
● The treadwear indicators are showing on a tire.
● You have tire damage such as cuts, splits, cracks deep enough to expose the fabric, and

bulges indicating internal damage.
● A tire goes flat repeatedly or cannot be properly repaired due to the size or location of

a cut or other damage.
If you are not sure, consult with your Lexus dealer.

■ Replacing tires and wheels
If the ID code of the tire pressure warning valve and transmitter is not registered, the tire 7
pressure warning system will not work properly. After driving for about 20 minutes, the
tire pressure warning light blinks for 1 minute and stays on to indicate a system malfunc-
tion.

■ Tire life
Any tire over 6 years old must be checked by a qualified technician even if it has seldom
or never been used or damage is not obvious.

■ Routine tire inflation pressure checks
The tire pressure warning system does not replace routine tire inflation pressure checks.
Make sure to check tire inflation pressure as part of your routine of daily vehicle checks.

NX200t_OM_USA_OM78081U

■ Maximum load of tire
Check that the maximum load of the replacement tire is greater than 1/2 of the Gross
Axle Weight Ratings (GAWR) of either the front axle or the rear axle, whichever is
greater.
For the GAWR, see the Certification Label. For
the maximum load of the tire, see the load limit
at maximum cold tire inflation pressure men-
tioned on the sidewall of the tire. (P. 602)

■ Tire types
● Summer tires

Summer tires are high-speed performance tires best suited to highway driving under
dry conditions. Since summer tires do not have the same traction performance as
snow tires, summer tires are inadequate for driving on snow-covered or icy roads. For
driving on snow-covered roads or icy roads, the use of snow tires is recommended.
When installing snow tires, be sure to replace all four tires.

● All season tires
All season tires are designed to provide better traction in snow and to be adequate for
driving in most winter conditions as well as for use year-round. All season tires, how-
ever, do not have adequate traction performance compared with snow tires in heavy
or loose snow. Also, all season tires fall short in acceleration and handling perfor-
mance compared with summer tires in highway driving.

● Snow tires
For driving on snow-covered roads or icy roads, we recommend using snow tires. If
you need snow tires, select tires of the same size, construction and load capacity as the
originally installed tires. Since your vehicle has radial tires as original equipment, make
sure your snow tires also have radial construction. Do not install studded tires without
first checking local regulations for possible restrictions. Snow tires should be installed
on all wheels. (P. 317)

■ Initializing the tire pressure warning system
Initialize the system with the tire inflation pressure adjusted to the specified level.

■ If the tread on snow tires wears down below 0.16 in. (4 mm)
The effectiveness of the tires as snow tires is lost.

7-3. Do-it-yourself maintenance 507

■ Situations in which the tire pressure warning system may not operate properly
● In the following cases, the tire pressure warning system may not operate properly.

• If non-genuine Lexus wheels are used.
• A tire has been replaced with a tire that is not an OE (Original Equipment) tire.
• A tire has been replaced with a tire that is not of the specified size.
• Tire chains etc. are equipped.
• An auxiliary-supported run-flat tire is equipped.
• If a window tint that affects the radio wave signals is installed.
• If there is a lot of snow or ice on the vehicle, particularly around the wheels or wheel

housings.
• If the tire inflation pressure is extremely higher than the specified level.
• If wheel without the tire pressure warning valve and transmitter is used.
• If the ID code on the tire pressure warning valves and transmitters is not registered

in the tire pressure warning computer.
● Performance may be affected in the following situations.

• Near a TV tower, electric power plant, gas station, radio station, large display, air-
port or other facility that generates strong radio waves or electrical noise

• When carrying a portable radio, cellular phone, cordless phone or other wireless
communication device

● When the vehicle is parked, the time taken for the warning to start or go off could be
extended.

● When tire inflation pressure declines rapidly for example when a tire has burst, the
warning may not function.

■ The initialization operation
● Make sure to carry out initialization after adjusting the tire inflation pressure.

Also, make sure the tires are cold before carrying out initialization or tire inflation pres-
sure adjustment.

● If you have accidentally turned the engine switch off during initialization, it is not neces-
sary to press the reset switch again as initialization will restart automatically when the
engine switch has been turned to IGNITION ON mode for the next time. 7

● If you accidentally press the reset switch when initialization is not necessary, adjust the
tire inflation pressure to the specified level when the tires are cold, and conduct initial-
ization again.

■ Warning performance of the tire pressure warning system
The warning of the tire pressure warning system will change in accordance with the con-
ditions under which it was initialized. For this reason, the system may give a warning even
if the tire pressure does not reach a low enough level, or if the pressure is higher than the
pressure that was adjusted to when the system was initialized.

■ When initialization of the tire pressure warning system has failed
Initialization can be completed in a few minutes. However, in the following cases, the set-
tings have not been recorded and the system will not operate properly. If repeated
attempts to record tire inflation pressure settings are unsuccessful, have the vehicle
inspected by your Lexus dealer.
● When operating the tire pressure warning reset switch, the tire pressure warning light

does not blink 3 times.
● After carrying out the initialization procedure, the tire pressure warning light blinks for

1 minute then stays on after driving for 20 minutes.

Do not forget to check the spare.

■ Effects of incorrect tire inflation pressure
Driving with incorrect tire inflation pressure may result in the following:
● Reduced fuel economy
● Reduced driving comfort and poor handling
● Reduced tire life due to wear
● Reduced safety
● Damage to the drive train
If a tire needs frequent inflating, have it checked by your Lexus dealer.

NX200t_OM_USA_OM78081U



7-3. Do-it-yourself maintenance 513

■ Instructions for checking tire inflation pressure
When checking tire inflation pressure, observe the following:
● Check only when the tires are cold.

If your vehicle has been parked for at least 3 hours or has not been driven for more than
1 mile or 1.5 km, you will get an accurate cold tire inflation pressure reading.

● Always use a tire pressure gauge.
It is difficult to judge if a tire is properly inflated based only on its appearance.

● It is normal for the tire inflation pressure to be higher after driving as heat is generated
in the tire. Do not reduce tire inflation pressure after driving.

● Never exceed the vehicle capacity weight.
Passengers and luggage weight should be placed so that the vehicle is balanced.

WARNING

■ Proper inflation is critical to save tire performance
Keep your tires properly inflated.
If the tires are not properly inflated, the following conditions may occur which could
lead to an accident resulting in death or serious injury:
● Excessive wear
● Uneven wear
● Poor handling
● Possibility of blowouts resulting from overheated tires
● Air leaking from between tire and wheel
● Wheel deformation and/or tire damage
● Greater possibility of tire damage while driving (due to road hazards, expansion

joints, sharp edges in the road, etc.)

Wheels

If a wheel is bent, cracked or heavily corroded, it should be replaced. Other-
wise, the tire may separate from the wheel or cause a loss of handling control.

Wheel selection
When replacing wheels, care should be taken to ensure that they are equivalent
to those removed in load capacity, diameter, rim width and inset*.
Replacement wheels are available at your Lexus dealer.
*: Conventionally referred to as “offset”.
Lexus does not recommend using the following:
● Wheels of different sizes or types
● Used wheels
● Bent wheels that have been straightened

Aluminum wheel precautions
● Use only Lexus wheel nuts and wrenches designed for use with your alumi-

num wheels.
● When rotating, repairing or changing your tires, check that the wheel nuts are

still tight after driving 1000 miles (1600 km).
● Be careful not to damage the aluminum wheels when using tire chains.
● Use only Lexus genuine balance weights or equivalent and a plastic or rubber

hammer when balancing your wheels.

■ When replacing wheels
The wheels of your vehicle are equipped with tire pressure warning valves and transmit-
ters that allow the tire pressure warning system to provide advance warning in the event
of a loss in tire inflation pressure. Whenever wheels are replaced, tire pressure warning
valves and transmitters must be installed. (P. 503, 515)

■ When the tire pressure warning light comes on
Inspect the appearance of the tire to check that the tire is not punctured.
If the tire is punctured: P. 560
If the tire is not punctured:
Carry out the following procedure after the tire temperature has lowered sufficiently.
● Check the tire inflation pressure and adjust to the appropriate level.
● If the warning light does not go out even after several minutes, check that the tire infla-

tion pressure is at the specified level and carry out initialization. (P. 504)
The warning light may come on again if the above operations are conducted without first
allowing the tire temperature to lower sufficiently.

■ The tire pressure warning light may come on due to natural causes
The tire pressure warning light may come on due to natural causes such as natural air
leaks and tire inflation pressure changes caused by temperature. In this case, adjusting
the tire inflation pressure will turn off the warning light (after a few minutes).

■ When a tire is replaced with a spare tire
Vehicles with a compact spare tire: The compact spare tire is not equipped with a tire
pressure warning valve and transmitter. If a tire goes flat, the tire pressure warning light
will not turn off even though the flat tire has been replaced with the spare tire. Replace
the spare tire with the repaired tire and adjust the tire inflation pressure. The tire pressure
warning light will go off after a few minutes.
Vehicles with a full-size spare tire: The spare tire is also equipped with a tire pressure
warning valve and transmitter. The tire pressure warning light will turn on if the tire infla-
tion pressure of the spare tire is low. If a tire goes flat, the tire pressure warning light will
not turn off even though the flat tire has been replaced with the spare tire. Replace the
spare tire with the repaired tire and adjust the tire inflation pressure. The tire pressure
warning light will go off after a few minutes.

■ Conditions that the tire pressure warning system may not function properly
P. 507

■ If the tire pressure warning light frequently comes on after blinking for 1 minute
If the tire pressure warning light frequently comes on after blinking for 1 minute when the
engine switch is turned to IGNITION ON mode, have it checked by your Lexus dealer.

■ Warning buzzer
In some cases, the buzzer may not be heard due to being in a noisy location or audio
sound.

WARNING

■ If both the ABS and the brake system warning lights remain on
Stop your vehicle in a safe place immediately and contact your Lexus dealer. The vehi-
cle will become extremely unstable during braking, and the ABS system may fail, which
could cause an accident resulting in death or serious injury.

■ When the electric power steering system warning light comes on
When the light comes on yellow, the assist to the power steering is restricted. When the
light comes on red, the assist to the power steering is lost and handling operations of
the steering wheel become extremely heavy. When steering wheel operations are
heavier than usual, grip the steering wheel firmly and operate it using more force than
usual.

■ If the tire pressure warning light comes on
Be sure to observe the following precautions. Failure to do so could cause a loss of
vehicle control and result in death or serious injury.
● Stop your vehicle in a safe place as soon as possible. Adjust the tire inflation pressure

immediately. 
● If the tire pressure warning light comes on even after tire inflation pressure adjust-

ment, it is probable that you have a flat tire. Check the tires. If a tire is flat, change it
with the spare tire and have the flat tire repaired by the nearest Lexus dealer.

● Avoid abrupt maneuvering and braking. If the vehicle tires deteriorate, you could lose
control of the steering wheel or the brakes.

■ If a blowout or sudden air leakage should occur
The tire pressure warning system may not activate immediately.

WARNING

■ Maintenance of the tires
Each tire, including the spare (if provided), should be checked monthly when cold and
inflated to the inflation pressure recommended by the vehicle manufacturer on the
vehicle placard or tire inflation pressure label (tire and load information label). (If your
vehicle has tires of a different size than the size indicated on the vehicle placard or tire
inflation pressure label [tire and load information label], you should determine the
proper tire inflation pressure for those tires.)
As an added safety feature, your vehicle has been equipped with a tire pressure moni-
toring system (TPMS-tire pressure warning system) that illuminates a low tire pressure
telltale (tire pressure warning light) when one or more of your tires is significantly
under-inflated. Accordingly, when the low tire pressure telltale (tire pressure warning
light) illuminates, you should stop and check your tires as soon as possible, and inflate
them to the proper pressure. Driving on a significantly under-inflated tire causes the
tire to overheat and can lead to tire failure. Under-inflation also reduces fuel efficiency
and tire tread life, and may affect the vehicle’s handling and stopping ability.
Please note that the TPMS (tire pressure warning system) is not a substitute for proper
tire maintenance, and it is the driver’s responsibility to maintain correct tire pressure,
even if under-inflation has not reached the level to trigger illumination of the TPMS low
tire pressure telltale (tire pressure warning light).
Your vehicle has also been equipped with a TPMS (tire pressure warning system) mal-
function indicator to indicate when the system is not operating properly. The TPMS
(tire pressure warning system) malfunction indicator is combined with the low tire pres-
sure telltale (tire pressure warning light). When the system detects a malfunction, the
telltale will flash for approximately one minute and then remain continuously illumi-
nated. This sequence will continue upon subsequent vehicle start-ups as long as the
malfunction exists. When the malfunction indicator is illuminated, the system may not
be able to detect or signal low tire pressure as intended.
TPMS (tire pressure warning system) malfunctions may occur for a variety of reasons,
including the installation of replacement or alternate tires or wheels on the vehicle that
prevent the TPMS (tire pressure warning system) from functioning properly. Always
check the TPMS (tire pressure warning system) malfunction telltale after replacing one
or more tires or wheels on your vehicle to ensure that the replacement or alternate
tires and wheels allow the TPMS (tire pressure warning system) to continue to function
properly.

NOTICE

■ To ensure the tire pressure warning system operates properly
Do not install tires with different specifications or makers, as the tire pressure warning
system may not operate properly.

WARNING

■ Replacing a flat tire
● Observe the following precautions.

Failure to do so may result in serious injury:
• Do not try to remove the wheel ornament by hand. Take due care in handling the

ornament to avoid unexpected personal injury.
• Do not touch the disc wheels or the area around the brakes immediately after the

vehicle has been driven.
After the vehicle has been driven the disc wheels and the area around the brakes
will be extremely hot. Touching these areas with hands, feet or other body parts
while changing a tire, etc. may result in burns.

● Failure to follow these precautions could cause the wheel nuts to loosen and the tire
to fall off, resulting in death or serious injury.
• Never use oil or grease on the wheel bolts or wheel nuts.

Oil and grease may cause the wheel nuts to be excessively tightened, leading to
bolt or disc wheel damage. In addition, the oil or grease can cause the wheel nuts
to loosen and the wheel may fall off, causing a serious accident.
Remove any oil or grease from the wheel bolts or wheel nuts.

• Have the wheel nuts tightened with a torque wrench to 76 ft•lbf (103 N•m,
10.5 kgf•m) as soon as possible after changing wheels.

• When installing a tire, only use wheel nuts that have been specifically designed for
that wheel.

• If there are any cracks or deformations in the bolt screws, nut threads or bolt holes
of the wheel, have the vehicle inspected by your Lexus dealer.

• Do not attach a heavily damaged wheel ornament, as it may fly off the wheel while
the vehicle is moving.

3 Connect the jumper cables according to the following procedure:

1 Connect a positive jumper cable clamp to the positive (+) battery terminal
on your vehicle.

2 Connect the clamp on the other end of the positive cable to the positive (+)
battery terminal on the second vehicle.

3 Connect a negative cable clamp to the negative (-) battery terminal on the
second vehicle.

4 Connect the clamp at the other end of the negative cable to a solid, station-
ary, unpainted metallic point away from the battery and any moving parts,
as shown in the illustration.

4 Start the engine of the second vehicle. Increase the engine speed slightly and
maintain at that level for approximately 5 minutes to recharge the battery of
your vehicle.

When trouble arises



582 8-2. Steps to take in an emergency

■ Starting the engine when the battery is discharged
The engine cannot be started by push-starting.

■ To prevent battery discharge
● Turn off the headlights and the audio system while the engine is off.
● Turn off any unnecessary electrical components when the vehicle is running at a low

speed for an extended period, such as in heavy traffic.
■ Charging the battery

The electricity stored in the battery will discharge gradually even when the vehicle is not
in use, due to natural discharge and the draining effects of certain electrical appliances. If
the vehicle is left for a long time, the battery may discharge, and the engine may be
unable to start. (The battery recharges automatically during driving.)

■ When the battery is removed or discharged
● In some cases, it may not be possible to unlock the doors using the smart access system

with push-button start when the battery is discharged. Use the wireless remote control
or the mechanical key to lock or unlock the doors.

● The engine may not start on the first attempt after the battery has recharged but will
start normally after the second attempt. This is not a malfunction.

● The engine switch mode is memorized by the vehicle. When the battery is recon-
nected, the system will return to the mode it was in before the battery was discharged.
Before disconnecting the battery, turn the engine switch off.
If you are unsure what mode the engine switch was in before the battery discharged, be
especially careful when reconnecting the battery.

● The power back door must be initialized. (P. 125)

WARNING

■ Avoiding battery fires or explosions
Observe the following precautions to prevent accidentally igniting the flammable gas
that may be emitted from the battery:
● Make sure each jumper cable is connected to the correct terminal and that it is not

unintentionally in contact with any other than the intended terminal.
● Do not allow the other end of the jumper cable connected to the “+” terminal to come

into contact with any other parts or metal surfaces in the area, such as brackets or
unpainted metal.

● Do not allow the + and - clamps of the jumper cables to come into contact with each
other.

● Do not smoke, use matches, cigarette lighters or allow open flame near the battery.
■ Battery precautions

The battery contains poisonous and corrosive acidic electrolyte, while related parts
contain lead and lead compounds. Observe the following precautions when handling
the battery:
● When working with the battery, always wear safety glasses and take care not to allow

any battery fluids (acid) to come into contact with skin, clothing or the vehicle body.
● Do not lean over the battery.
● In the event that battery fluid comes into contact with the skin or eyes, immediately

wash the affected area with water and seek medical attention.
Place a wet sponge or cloth over the affected area until medical attention can be
received.

● Always wash your hands after handling the battery support, terminals, and other bat-
tery-related parts.

● Do not allow children near the battery.

NOTICE

play.
If the message does not disappear:
Stop the engine and contact your Lexus dealer.
If the message is not displayed:
Have the vehicle inspected at the nearest Lexus dealer.

WARNING

■ To prevent an accident or injury when inspecting under the hood of your vehicle
Observe the following precautions.
Failure to do so may result in serious injury such as burns.
● If steam is seen coming from under the hood, do not open the hood until the steam

has subsided. The engine compartment may be very hot.
● Keep hands and clothing (especially a tie, a scarf or a muffler) away from the fans and

belts. Failure to do so may cause the hands or clothing to be caught, resulting in seri-
ous injury.

● Do not loosen the coolant reservoir cap while the engine and radiator are hot.
High temperature steam or coolant could spray out.

NOTICE

■ When adding engine coolant
Add coolant slowly after the engine has cooled down sufficiently. Adding cool coolant
to a hot engine too quickly can cause damage to the engine.

■ To prevent damage to the cooling system
Observe the following precautions:
● Avoid contaminating the coolant with foreign matter (such as sand or dust etc.).
● Do not use any coolant additive.

■ Engine oil selection
“Toyota Genuine Motor Oil SAE 0W-20 for Direct Injection Turbo Gasoline
Engines” is used in your Lexus vehicle. Use Lexus approved “Toyota Genuine
Motor Oil SAE 0W-20 for Direct Injection Turbo Gasoline Engines” or
equivalent to satisfy the following grade and viscosity.
Oil grade: “Toyota Genuine Motor Oil SAE 0W-20 for Direct Injection Turbo
Gasoline Engines” or ILSAC GF-5 multigrade engine oil
Recommended viscosity: SAE 0W-20
SAE 0W-20 is the best choice for
good fuel economy and good start-
ing in cold weather.
If SAE 0W-20 is not available, SAE
5W-20 oil may be used. However, it
must be replaced with SAE 0W-20
at the next oil change.

Outside temperature

Oil viscosity (0W-20 is explained here as an example):

• The 0W in 0W-20 indicates the characteristic of the oil which allows cold
startability. Oils with a lower value before the W allow for easier starting of
the engine in cold weather.

• The 20 in 0W-20 indicates the viscosity characteristic of the oil when the
oil is at high temperature. An oil with a higher viscosity (one with a higher
value) may be better suited if the vehicle is operated at high speeds, or
under extreme load conditions.

How to read oil container label:
The International Lubricant Specifi-
cation Advisory Committee
(ILSAC) Certification Mark is added 9

Fuel information

You must only use unleaded gasoline in your vehicle. 
Select premium unleaded gasoline with an octane rating of 91 (Research
Octane Number 96) or higher required for optimum engine performance. If
91 octane cannot be obtained, you may use unleaded gasoline with an octane
rating as low as 87 (Research Octane Number 91). Use of unleaded gasoline
with an octane rating lower than 91 may result in engine knocking and signifi-
cantly reduced performance. Persistent knocking can lead to engine damage
and should be corrected by refueling with higher octane unleaded gasoline.

At minimum, the gasoline you use should meet the specifications of ASTM
D4814 in the U.S.A.

■ Gasoline quality
In very few cases, driveability problems may be caused by the brand of gasoline you are
using. If driveability problems persist, try changing the brand of gasoline. If this does not
correct the problem, consult your Lexus dealer.

■ Gasoline quality standards
● Automotive manufacturers in the U.S.A., Europe and Japan have developed a specifi-

cation for fuel quality called the World-Wide Fuel Charter (WWFC), which is expected
to be applied worldwide.

● The WWFC consists of four categories that are based on required emission levels. In
the U.S., category 4 has been adopted.

● The WWFC improves air quality by lowering emissions in vehicle fleets, and improves
customer satisfaction through better performance.

■ Recommendation of the use of gasoline containing detergent additives
● Lexus recommends the use of gasoline that contains detergent additives to avoid the

build-up of engine deposits.
● All gasoline sold in the U.S.A. contains minimum detergent additives to clean and/or

keep clean intake systems, per EPA’s lowest additives concentration program.
● Lexus strongly recommends the use of Top Tier Detergent Gasoline. For more informa- 9

tion on Top Tier Detergent Gasoline and a list of marketers, please go to the official
website www.toptiergas.com.

NX200t_OM_USA_OM78081U

Vehicle specifications



600 9-1. Specifications

■ Recommendation of the use of low emissions gasoline
Gasolines containing oxygenates such as ethers and ethanol, as well as reformulated
gasolines, are available in some cities. These fuels are typically acceptable for use, pro-
viding they meet other fuel requirements.
Lexus recommends these fuels, since the formulations allow for reduced vehicle emis-
sions.

■ Non-recommendation of the use of blended gasoline
● Use only gasoline containing up to 15% etha-

nol. DO NOT use gasoline 
DO NOT use any flex-fuel or gasoline that containing more than 
could contain more than 15% ethanol, includ- 15% ethanol.
ing from any pump labeled E30, E50, E85
(which are only some examples of fuel con- (30% ethanol)
taining more than 15% ethanol).

(50% ethanol)

(85% ethanol)

● If you use gasohol in your vehicle, be sure that it has an octane rating no lower than 87.
● Lexus does not recommend the use of gasoline containing methanol.

■ Non-recommendation of the use of gasoline containing MMT
Some gasoline contains an octane enhancing additive called MMT
(Methylcyclopentadienyl Manganese Tricarbonyl).
Lexus does not recommend the use of gasoline that contains MMT. If fuel containing
MMT is used, your emission control system may be adversely affected.
The malfunction indicator lamp on the instrument cluster may come on. If this happens,
contact your Lexus dealer for service.

■ If your engine knocks
● Consult your Lexus dealer.
● You may occasionally notice light knocking for a short time while accelerating or driv-

ing uphill. This is normal and there is no need for concern.

NX200t_OM_USA_OM78081U



9-1. Specifications 601

NOTICE

■ Notice on fuel quality
● Do not use improper fuels. If improper fuels are used, the engine will be damaged.
● Do not use leaded gasoline.

Leaded gasoline can cause damage to your vehicle’s three-way catalytic converters
causing the emission control system to malfunction.

● Do not use gasohol other than the type previously stated.
Other gasohol may cause fuel system damage or vehicle performance problems.

● Using unleaded gasoline with an octane number or rating lower than the level previ-
ously stated will cause persistent heavy knocking.
At worst, this will lead to engine damage.

■ Fuel-related poor driveability
If poor driveability (poor hot starting, vaporization, engine knocking, etc.) is encoun-
tered after using a different type of fuel, discontinue the use of that type of fuel.

■ When refueling with gasohol
Take care not to spill gasohol. It can damage your vehicle’s paint.

Uniform Tire Quality Grading
This information has been prepared in accordance with regulations issued by the
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration of the U.S. Department of Trans-
portation.
It provides the purchasers and/or prospective purchasers of Lexus vehicles with
information on uniform tire quality grading.

Your Lexus dealer will help answer any questions you may have as you read this infor-
mation.

■ DOT quality grades
All passenger vehicle tires must conform to Federal Safety Requirements in
addition to these grades. Quality grades can be found where applicable on
the tire sidewall between tread shoulder and maximum section width.

For example: Treadwear 200 Traction AA Temperature A

NX200t_OM_USA_OM78081U



9-1. Specifications 607

■ Treadwear
The treadwear grade is a comparative rating based on the wear rate of the tire
when tested under controlled conditions on a specified government test
course.

For example, a tire graded 150 would wear one and a half (1 - 1/2) times as well on
the government course as a tire graded 100.
The relative performance of tires depends upon the actual conditions of their use,
however, and may depart significantly from the norm due to variations in driving
habits, service practices and differences in road characteristics and climate.

■ Traction AA, A, B, C
The traction grades, from highest to lowest, are AA, A, B and C, and they rep-
resent the tire’s ability to stop on wet pavement as measured under controlled
conditions on specified government test surfaces of asphalt and concrete.

A tire marked C may have poor traction performance.
Warning: The traction grade assigned to this tire is based on braking (straight
ahead) traction tests and does not include cornering (turning) traction.

■ Temperature A, B, C
The temperature grades are A (the highest), B, and C, representing the tire’s
resistance to the generation of heat and its ability to dissipate heat when
tested under controlled conditions on a specified indoor laboratory test
wheel.

Sustained high temperature can cause the material of the tire to degenerate and
reduce tire life, and excessive temperature can lead to sudden tire failure.
Grade C corresponds to a level of performance which all passenger car tires must
meet under the Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard No. 109.
Grades B and A represent higher levels of performance on the laboratory test
wheel than the minimum required by law.
Warning: The temperature grades for this tire are established for a tire that is prop-
erly inflated and not overloaded.
Excessive speed, underinflation, or excessive loading, either separately or in com-
bination, can cause heat buildup and possible tire failure.

À défaut, des blessures graves, voire mortelles, pourraient s’ensuivre.
● Le conducteur et tous les passagers à bord du véhicule doivent porter leur ceinture

de sécurité correctement.
Les coussins gonflables SRS sont des dispositifs de protection complémentaires aux
ceintures de sécurité.

● Le coussin gonflable SRS conducteur se déploie avec une puissance considérable et
peut occasionner des blessures graves, voire mortelles, notamment lorsque le
conducteur se trouve très près du coussin gonflable. L’autorité fédérale chargée de la
sécurité routière aux États-Unis, la NHTSA (National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration) conseille:
Sachant que la zone à risque du coussin gonflable conducteur se trouve dans les
premiers 2 à 3 in. (50 - 75 mm) de déploiement, vous disposez d’une marge de
sécurité confortable en vous plaçant à 10 in. (250 mm) du coussin gonflable
conducteur. Cette distance est à mesurer entre le moyeu du volant de direction et le
sternum. Si vous vous tenez à moins de 10 in. (250 mm), vous pouvez changer votre
position de conduite de plusieurs façons:
• Reculez votre siège le plus possible, tout en continuant à pouvoir atteindre

confortablement les pédales.
• Inclinez légèrement le dossier du siège. Même si les véhicules sont conçus

différemment, la plupart des conducteurs peuvent maintenir une distance de 10 in.
(250 mm), même si le siège se trouve complètement vers l’avant, simplement en
inclinant un peu le dossier du siège vers l’arrière. Si vous avez des difficultés à voir
la route après avoir incliné votre siège, utilisez un coussin ferme et antidérapant
pour vous rehausser ou, si votre véhicule est équipé du réglage en hauteur du
siège, remontez-le.

• Si votre volant de direction est réglable, inclinez-le vers le bas. Cela vous permet
d’orienter le coussin gonflable vers votre buste plutôt que vers la tête et le cou.

Le siège doit être réglé selon les recommandations de la NHTSA ci-dessus, tout en
conservant le contrôle des pédales et du volant, et la vue des commandes au tableau
de bord.

AVERTISSEMENT

■ Précautions avec les coussins gonflables SRS
● Si vous attachez une rallonge de ceinture de

sécurité aux boucles des ceintures de sièges
avant, mais pas au pêne de la ceinture de
sécurité proprement dite, les coussins
gonflables SRS frontaux déterminent que le
conducteur et le passager avant portent leur
ceinture de sécurité, alors même qu’elle n’est
pas attachée. Dans ce cas, les coussins
gonflables SRS frontaux risquent de ne pas se
déployer correctement en cas de collision,
causant des blessures graves, voire mortelles.
Veillez à porter la ceinture de sécurité avec la
rallonge de ceinture de sécurité.

● Le coussin gonflable SRS passager avant se déploie également avec une puissance
considérable et peut occasionner des blessures graves, voire mortelles, notamment
lorsque le passager avant se trouve très près du coussin gonflable. Le siège du
passager avant doit se trouver le plus loin possible du coussin gonflable et le dossier
doit être réglé de manière à ce que le passager avant soit assis bien droit.

● Le déploiement d’un coussin gonflable peut infliger des blessures graves, voire
mortelles, aux nourrissons et aux enfants mal assis et/ou mal attachés. Installez dans
un siège de sécurité enfant les enfants trop jeunes pour pouvoir utiliser la ceinture de
sécurité. Lexus recommande vivement d’installer tous les nourrissons et enfants aux
places arrière du véhicule et de prévoir pour eux des systèmes de retenue adaptés.
Les sièges arrière sont plus sûrs pour les nourrissons et les enfants que le siège
passager avant.

● N’installez jamais un siège de sécurité enfant type dos à la route sur le siège passager
avant, même si le témoin indicateur “AIR BAG OFF” est allumé. En cas d’accident, la
force exercée par le déploiement rapide du coussin gonflable passager avant peut
causer des blessures graves, voire mortelles à un enfant, si le siège de sécurité enfant
type dos à la route est installé sur le siège passager avant.

AVERTISSEMENT

■ Précautions avec les coussins gonflables SRS
● Ne pas s’asseoir sur le bord du siège et ne pas

s’appuyer contre la planche de bord.

● Ne pas laisser un enfant rester debout devant
le coussin gonflable SRS passager avant ni
assis sur les genoux du passager avant.

● Ne pas laisser les occupants des sièges avant
voyager avec un objet sur les genoux.

● Ne pas s’appuyer contre la porte, contre le
rail latéral de toit ou contre les montants
avant, latéraux et arrière.

● Interdisez à quiconque de s’agenouiller sur le
siège passager en appui contre la porte ou de
sortir la tête ou les mains à l’extérieur du
véhicule.

AVERTISSEMENT

■ Précautions avec les coussins gonflables SRS
● Ne rien fixer ou disposer sur la planche de

bord, la garniture centrale du moyeu de
volant de direction et la partie inférieure du
tableau de bord. 
Lors du déploiement des coussins gonflables
SRS conducteur, passager avant et de
genoux, tout objet risque de se transformer
en projectile.

● Ne rien fixer aux portes, à la vitre de pare-
brise, aux vitres latérales, aux montants avant
et arrière, au rail latéral de toit et à la poignée
de maintien.

● Ne pas suspendre aux crochets à vêtements un cintre nu ni aucun objet dur ou
tranchant. En cas de déploiement des coussins gonflables SRS rideau, tous ces objets
pourraient se transformer en projectiles et causer des blessures graves, voire
mortelles.

● Si une housse en vinyle recouvre la partie où le coussins gonflable SRS de genoux se
déploie, veillez à l’enlever.

● N’utilisez pour les sièges aucun accessoire venant recouvrir les parties où se
déploient les coussins gonflables SRS latéraux et le coussin gonflable SRS d’assise de
siège, car il risquerait de gêner le déploiement des coussins gonflables SRS. De tels
accessoires peuvent empêcher les coussins gonflables SRS latéraux et d’assise de
siège de s’activer correctement, neutraliser le système ou provoquer le déploiement
accidentel des coussins gonflables SRS latéraux et d’assise de siège, provoquant ainsi
des blessures graves, voire mortelles.

● Évitez de faire subir des chocs ou des pressions excessives aux parties renfermant les
composants des coussins gonflables SRS. 
En effet, cela pourrait entraîner un mauvais fonctionnement des coussins gonflables
SRS.

● Ne touchez aucun composant du système immédiatement après le déclenchement
(déploiement) des coussins gonflables SRS, car ils sont alors encore très chauds.

AVERTISSEMENT

■ Précautions avec les coussins gonflables SRS
● Si vous avez des difficultés à respirer après le déploiement des coussins gonflables

SRS, ouvrez une porte ou une vitre pour faire entrer de l’air frais, ou bien descendez
du véhicule si cela ne présente pas de danger. Retirez tout résidu dès que possible
afin d’éviter d’éventuelles irritations de la peau. 

● Si les parties renfermant les coussins gonflables SRS, telles que la garniture du moyeu
de volant et les garnitures de montants avant et arrière, apparaissent abîmées ou
craquelées, faites-les remplacer par votre concessionnaire Lexus.

● Ne rien poser sur le siège du passager avant, comme un coussin par exemple. Cela a
pour conséquence de répartir le poids du passager sur toute la surface du siège, ce
qui empêche le capteur de détecter normalement le poids du passager. En
conséquence, les coussins gonflables SRS frontaux du passager avant peuvent ne
pas se déployer en cas de collision.

■ Modification et élimination en fin de vie des éléments du système de coussins
gonflables SRS
Consultez impérativement votre concessionnaire Lexus si vous avez besoin
d’intervenir sur votre véhicule ou de procéder à l’une des modifications suivantes. Les
coussins gonflables SRS peuvent ne pas fonctionner correctement ou se déployer (se
gonfler) accidentellement, provoquant ainsi des blessures graves, voire mortelles.
● Installation, dépose, démontage et réparations des coussins gonflables SRS
● Réparations, modifications, démontage ou remplacement du volant, du tableau de

bord, de la planche de bord, des sièges ou de leur garnissage, des montants avant,
latéraux et arrière ou des rails latéraux de toit

● Réparation ou modification des ailes avant, du bouclier avant, ou des flancs de
l’habitacle

● Installation d’un équipement de protection sur la calandre (pare-buffle, pare-
kangourou, etc.), d’un chasse-neige, de treuils ou d’une galerie de toit 

● Modification des suspensions du véhicule
● Installation d’appareils électroniques, tels qu’un émetteur/récepteur radio ou lecteur

de CD
● Aménagements du véhicule visant à permettre sa conduite par une personne

atteinte d’un handicap physique
